"We received the phones earlier than what was projected, which was great. When we opened the box, both phones were brand new. Not used or refurbished. Opening the Apple box, everything the listing said was included was new and in the box. We knew it did not come with the wall adapter but this was expected thanks to the post showing what was included in the box. Both phones function well and in my area, nothing beats Straight talk service as far as prepaid goes. The XRs are worth every penny and we got them at a great deal with this purchase."
"Ordered on 11.27.2020 and received by 12.02.2020 SO FAR SO GOOD I was worried when I read the reviews about Items not showing up, Items missing, water damage etc... Although I will say I haven't had any issues. Phone works perfectly, I already went through Straight talk for my phone service"
I love my phone but didnt come with charger block that way I was expecting to see but I love my phone
I love this phone!!! It is exactly what I wanted and if I didn't already have it I would buy it again!!
Great price . Came within 2 day delivery .
It was in new condition and I love this phone so many features
Went in and got mine on the 27 I absolutely love the phone it's definitely a step up from the 7
fast delivery. easy setup. easy to use. great video and photo quality.
"I love this phone but I'm only having one issue with it, nothing to bad just annoying, when I get a text message it pops up I click on it and respond but then I click the last app open to return to it on the top left and it brings me to a blank screen that says search instead of YouTube or a game I'm playing, the picture shows no matter what I'm on it brings me back to this"
I loved the phone! Didnt like the fact that I needed to buy a special block for charger. You would think it comes with a complete charger. If you get this order a block that goes with it too.
I bought this to replace a buggy iPhone SE that would not stop freezing. We tried everything & even Apple said it was cabbage. This model is a little bigger than the SE but not by much. The camera & screen are better operation is fine for general use. Pretty happy after one month.
This Apple iPhone XR is one of the best ones that I've had an absolutely works for my needs the light color is like a really young vibrant and easy to use absolutely fantastic
Phone was brand new in Apple box packaging was not used so that was great. Battery health was at 100%. No signs that this phone was ever used and everything works fine. The only negative I can say is that the transfer of a phone number to straight talk literally took a long time and was completed  a couple of hours near the 24hr mark.
The phone is used and I have one that I got brand new from Verizon and I matched the phones together to see if the phone was used it looks like the phone been in water and it don't show up bright like when you go to the message and stuff you can look at the phone and tell it had water damage or something and no wall block came with it and they sent the wrong charger and it two almost two weeks to get here I will be returning this and going to the store to get a brand new one
ordered phone on sat black Friday sale online and I my phone made it in on 11/15.. Opened the box i was missing my charger they have the wrong USB and no headphones smh..Will most definitely order in store next time!! Talk to customer service and i was instructed to send the phone back and wait another few days for a replacement phone in which im hoping its right this time around smh.The box was even weird never seen anything like this EVER!!
"This phone broke after one month and I cannot return because it is past the return date! Phone will not turn on, only flashes the apple logo and shuts off. Now my son has lost all of his photos. We can't transfer anything to a new phone because this one won't turn on. Total waste of money! Will never order a phone through Walmart again!"
I purchased this iPhone for my teenage son. It was a perfect fit for him. The technology is amazing with great features. It is also durable and still in great condition with little maintenance after a year and a half.
"For what youre getting its a reasonable wait and price.Couldn't even tell it was used, I like it."
This is a great phone and is better than my 7 plus the phone I got was amazing and all I had to do was transfer my SIM card and the phone was ready my only problem is that the phone came dead
"Caught this on sale for $299.  Love this phone!  Big change from Android to iPhone, but that was expected.  Only issue I had is there was no wall charger included only a lightning USB-C cable, which fit nothing I already had.  So I couldn't even charge it without a trip to the store and another $20 purchase.  For as much as iPhones cost, a wall charger should be included.  Every Android phone I have ever purchased has included the wall charger and USB cable."
"If I could give this a 0 star I would! Bought this phone in November for a birthday present. Started using it in December, in March in bit the dust! Stuck on the apple logo. Tried booking it up to iTunes. Nothing happens. Apple support couldn't help either."
"The phone is absolutely amazing. The phone is brand new, and there are no problems with it whatsoever.  The package however only includes the box, the phone, and a charger wire.  It does not include the power adapter or earbuds, which is fine for me. But, you shuold keep it in mind buying the phone. Overall, I have no hesitation with giving 5 stars!!."
After having an iPhone 6s Plus since 2015 I finally upgraded to the XR. My old phone was not updating anymore. The screen blacked out all the time. Couldn't make phone calls anymore. I was so tired of it. This phone is awesome! Camera 10/10. Talk time 10/10. Battery life 10/10. I love my XR!!
The phone was offered at a great price.  I did not however receive 2 day delivery as Walmart promised.  Fed Ex delivery was first delayed and then they sent my package to the wrong local office.  Walmart should have options for buyers to select a carrier for delivery.  I would never choose Fed Ex.
Love it
I LOVE IT!???
The phone is good. Came on time not damage. However the Straight Talk locked to Carrier made it bad. I've used straight talk my whole life and never had a problem until now. I usually just switch the sim cards on my phone because they're all straight talk phone. When I did this for the XR is was a little different. It worked at first but everytime I lost signal it would say Cellular Error and contact apple or carrier. The only way to fix it is keep restarting the Network setting when you get signal. After contacting apple there best solution was to get a new sim card. Straight talk on the other had was no help at all. They recommended a soft restart which didn't fix it. The best problem I had after all this is I can't activate the phone by ...
"Bought the phone in November for my granddaughter santa present.  When it was opened to set it up it would not turn on.  Put it on charger , still would not turn on completely dead.  Walmart said Warranty was out because I received it Nov. 8 2022 and did not open till Christmas. Now my granddaughter had no santa phone."
"Phone did not work at all. System will not restore and Walmart will not allow me to return it because it has been sitting, unopened, in my drawer for more than three months. I bought it as a replacement just in case... Be very careful....products may be faulty and will not allow returns if you don't use it right away."
Phone was stuck SOS mode. Motherboard was messed up. Would of had to pay out of pocket for something that was messed up when I received it.
The phone I received had to be fixed within the first two days due to the phone getting hot and screen not coming on
I had to use a 3rd party to put the screws in the phone because there was none in the phone when I got it. I used the phone 2 weeks and it broke.
"Purchased as a Straight Talk phone; received as a Total Wireless phone. After multiple calls, it has been determined that due to ""improper scan at 'chechout'"" phone cannot be activated be either Straight Talk or Total Wireless."
"Phone was excellent but I didn't receive any headphones, a charger block, or a regular charging wire."
"Ordered xr iPhone on Saturday during back Friday sale , got phone 2 days late , no charger no manual,  nothing but the phone took it to my local walmart no help had to refund,  very disappointed,  phone 299 good price"
"The phone that ordered did not get scanned properly and was unable to be unlocked by my carrier! Apparently it happens a lot, according to the customer service representative that I spoke with! Never again ."
Phone stopped working cut on and off by itself with no harm to it
It broke in one week it malfunction and the wouldn't fix it
I am so happy and pleased with my refurbished. iPhone it work like it never been used before.
"wonderful phone. does everything the newest iphone does for cheaper . great size . you dont get headphone but i dont think apple supplies you with them anymore. i believe they come 
separate, which is fine for me . the charger is not usb, i think its called a c adapter . but phone port is still same size so it will work with the charger you have now ! also has wireless charging ! only thing is the camera might not be a grand as the newest iphone but i love it ! came brand new as well!"
"I love this phone! I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus. I had to get used to the changes but It didn't take long (no home button, using face recognition instead of fingerprint etc). Also, FYI it does not come with a charger box or headphones so make sure you get those separately"
"The phone is beautiful,nice big screen size good sound it was easy to set up an everything. I gave it 4 stars because the phone does not come with charger box or earphones,I was completely confused.I thought I got sold a knock off phone or something,because I never seen a brand new iPhone that didnt come with earphones an a complete charger.It comes with the cord part of the charger not the box,also the charger is not what I was use to seeing the part that connects to the box is a round piece not square.So the part that connects to ur phone is the normal iPhone charger piece but the end that connects to the box is what I think is called a usb c charger.Moving on I easily ordered the box from another site for about $9,it was just the inconve..."
"I love this phone, it went on sale and it was perfect timing because I had just had my 7 plus crap out on me after only having it 6 months. The home button got broken during our move, while in its Otterbox defender case. And when I went to reset it to be able to get to settings and use the assistive touch instead of the home button, it never came back on. Even with hard reset, restore from iTunes, and even tried a factory reset with iTunes. So I decided the home button needed to go. Especially since only Apple can replace it to where it has fingerprint functionality. So the XR is the perfect upgrade for me. No home button and VERY easy to get used to. The phone is near the same weight as the 7 plus, just a bit heavier. so my only worry was ..."
"Ordered mine on 12/14/20 and it came on the 18th so it took fast for me. Reading the reviews made me kinda nervous but I pushed that aside. 
The phone was wrapped very well in bubble wrap inside the box. Like the reviews said, it didnt come with headphones or charging block, but it didnt bother me since I already have that stuff. But it came with the charging cord. Phone is brand new and popped my SIM card into it (I use straight talk already) no issues with the phone at all that I know off and for $350 this is a great deal."
Great phone 100% battery health and most phones offline doesn't come that way. No blemishes or scratches great phone overall . It comes in the original iPhone box it's just didn't have any headphones or wall adapter . But will buy again very happy customer.
My old phone died  and I needed a replacement  Bought the same one we got our daughter. Works great.
the literal worst. the sim activiation stopped half way through and then it glitched and straighttalk qont fix it
Phone was new in the box no scratches or anything…also came with sims cards…arrived in 3 days…great buy I would buy again
Have ordered and returned this items twice.  Both of them stopped working. Won't buy phone online again!
Good phone so far it was for my son he say it works good it don't come with a block but came with a charge cord he said it's best to get a C-Charging block otherwise it'll charge a little slow
I have owned a lot of phones. This is the worst phone I have ever owned.  It may work perfect for a few minutes and then won't open an app or freeze up. It has a mind of its own.
Love the purchase but the cord was the charger with no block. The phone did come dead but Im thinking its because of the cold. The phone showed up on time and I cant wait to use it!!!!
It came in the original apple box!! not only that but the battery capacity is at 100% and there's no scratches or scuffs! it comes with the food fast charger !! definitely will be buying again!!
Cannot activate the phone
Make sure it is compatible with carrier! It states Straight Talk phone but it was not!
"Highly disappointed that the phone did not come with a charging block, normal USB charging cord, and earphones/buds. There is absolutely no way to charge phone, especially when switching from an android."
Everything is great with the phone once I finally received it. FedEx is the most confused delivery service I have ever dealt with and constantly losing packages.  I will never order again if they are delivering it.
Brand new nothing wrong with it it said to be here Thursday March 18th 2021 but came today Wednesday March 17th 2021 I'm loving it already I have a seven plus now but just wanted a new phone
"It works just like a new phone. The battery life is really long it lasted 2 days without being charged for me. When I tried to set up my service that is where I found my issue but, the issues wasn't the phone. My little holler didn't have tower for my phone to connect to. Phone works perfect now I can make and receive calls. Camera is really good. I love it."
i bought it for my daughter an it wont let us activate it because the sim card that came with it says it dont exist so we are very disappointed with it on her sweet sixteen to.
"Needed to upgrade and saw this on sale for the black friday deals. Genuinely impressed by the phone. Still getting used to it because I have been an Android user all my life. Overall, I am enjoying the phone. Camera is great and phone runs pretty smooth. Battery last a long time for me. Depends on the user as well. But the battery last quite awhile."
"Ordered 2 phns one for my son and INE for myself-my sins came with no charging block nor headphones, that was the first inconvenience-and mine ...well I still haven’t been able to connect my service to it because they FORGOT to “scan” it stating it’s been purchased. So pretty much it’s as if I walked out of the store with it and didn’t pay for it!!! I called online customer service and they said it would take at least 48 hours to get an email from a different department to clear the phone-phones were purchased online through Walmart on the 19th of November!!!! Today is the 29th of December and yup still nothing. My sons is actives but mine is not. Luckily I had a extra block so he can charge his phone. Terrible to say the least!!!!"
"I switched over from Android to Apple now several months ago. I absolutely love this phone! I chose this model due to never owning and not knowing how to use any Apple products. I adjusted within a few days and have found that this phone is perfect! I was able to customize it exactly how I wanted and the camera is great. If you're looking to upgrade from an olde remodel, I recommend this phone. I have yet to have any issues and it doesn't lag And for a Great price!"
I swapped from my s7 once with the 11 and hated it. Finally swapping to this xr and sticking with it cause its actually a great phone. It has amazing battery life (better than the 11). Idk what the hates about cause I got nothing to complain about. Its just different from Android but still happy I committed and purchased this while on sale.
"Excellent phone. Purchased for our 12 year old that needed an upgrade from the iPhone 6. Upload time is so much faster, clean, crisp pictures, and a quality phone for less then the 11 or 12. We've had no problems with it whatsoever, it was brand new, in box, and I paid a little under $200 for it."
"I am a first time IPhone user and is liking it so far. I'm still getting used to it after being an Team Android. The biggest issue is the phone did not come with the charger adapter or headphones like the previous ones. I had to spend more money. Also, FedEx did a poor delivery job."
I bought the phone for my 16 year old son and he is beyond happy!! It is very easy to navigate through and it's not too light nor too heavy.. the volume is Great!!! And it only took me about 10 minutes to get it fully activated and he hasn't been off the phone since..
Ive had this for a month now and it was the best purchase Ive ever made. I had the 6s plus before this and theres a huge difference in speed and performance. Its way faster and the charger is very fast. It will go from 10 percent to 100 percent in about half hour. I highly recommend this phone for anyone looking to upgrade from a older iPhone.
Bought coral xr 2 months ago and the other day I had to order a brand new phone but this time from the straight talk website since the phone died and wouldn't turn back on the screen was just black no battery sign or anything was coming up so wasted $350 buying a phone form Walmart and this was my first time doing so since straight talk website didn't have any colors just black and Walmart did. Never again I'll be ordering right from straight talk like I've always done. Be cautious at first line worked fine and even the day it stopped no issues.
"Brand new iPhone XR works greatly and functions good. Included the SIM card, and charging cable. No charging cube was included, so hopefully you have one. It was an adjustment getting use to no home button but rather prefer it now. The screen is nice and large, and the volume levels reach higher than my previous phone which was the 6S. Easy to set up, all info transferred right from my old device onto this one. Great phone for the price it's at if you are looking to upgrade."
"I love this phone, the price was excellent and I didnt have any trouble setting it up. I was able to put in my old SIM card and it worked beautifully. This phone is great, the camera is better than my old google pixel 2xl and I love how responsive the phone is when scrolling through the apps. A great buy and I would definitely recommend!"
It wasn't on time and it didn't work
Arrived quickly and brand new but there is not a sim card included.
"Don't buy this, straight talk is charging $300 for unlock this."
as soon a the return window closed to send it back it stopped working and wouldn't charge
Perfect condition. Works perfectly. Great price.
"The phone works perfectly well I had a iPhone 7 that didn't work well and wanted a new phone, this one is the way to go"
Phone didn't even last a year and the battery went to completely out phone won't charge to turn on at all
"I am very pleased with this purchase. It's not the newest iPhone, but it is very affordable without the monthly payments. I love it!"
Purchased at walmart.com and said it arrived but there was no phone in the box when opened just paper!
"Shipping took longer than expected, they changed the arrival date 3 times but the phone came brand new and I had no trouble getting it set up."
Love the phone wish they had other color options and gigabyte options but the phone is great battery and display is amazing and is a great deal compared to buying it form apple!
I was unable to use the phone or add service to it. It was sold by Walmart for another outside company. It was complete trash. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!
"Brand new iPhone XR for 350 bucks I upgraded from a galaxy s7 sky pro , wish I did it along time ago, plenty of storage and way better camera and video, and all I had to do was switch SIM card and download a transfer app for photos, easy"
I'm so happy I ordered this phone! Came a day early and perfect condition! Just didn't have a charging block so had to buy one but other than that fine!!
"I've been a faithful Apple user since July 2010. I started out with an iPhone 3, and over the years I've upgraded when my phone had died. It might not be the newest Apple phone, but this thing is awesome compared to the iPhone 7 I just got rid of!"
I bought this phone and later decided to change service providers and was told they would not unlock the phone until I have had their service for a certain length of time. So I can't do what I want with a phone I paid for in full.
"My daughter had one of these for two years, so i knew what I was getting.  I previously had an iPhone 7, I was relatively happy with it, but the battery became utterly useless.  This phone is a minor upgrade from the iPhone 7.  I paid a little bit more than I did for the 7.  I'm not one to pay exorbitant amounts for a phone for myself.   This phone has a few minor upgrades from the 7.  It has better battery life, the screen is bigger so technically it has a higher resolution.  Technically the pixels per inch are the same as the 7, but the image quality of the screen is a significant improvement.  The color accuracy is pretty impressive.  Way better than any iPhone I've seen before this one.  I love the bigger screen.  I have been a fan of t..."
"they start bugging wanting reviews about same day of recieving. not sure about how long phone will last only been using it for a couple days. the bad so far was packaging came in over sized box with very small piece of bubble wrap thrown on top while the phone was able to slide all over. 
   far as phone so far seem good enough for me wish was little bigger but like the full screen.  still new and playing with phone but so far it does every thing my 6s plus did and runs same 14.2 system.  i had a few people say they couldnt get their 6 plus to update to the 14.2 system but mine did. i would say only reason to pay for a diffrent phone would be the full screen. if you have the older phone that is updating keep it. the xr has slightly better f..."
Ok so I just purchased this phone . Overall I love the phone itself. The only issue I had was it did not come with a SIM card and the charging cable I can't even use with the actual phone . So if you purchase this phone you may not receive a SIM card . I had to go and purchase a BYOP kit at Walmart call straight talks customer service to have them activate it for me . It's just came in a box with no red straight talk activation info that straight talk phone usually have with it
First of all they delivered into the wrong house i was really nervous back then suddenly one old kind man came to our house and gave the package itself to me i was very grateful earlier jesus thanks god blessed that man hope every person like that! btw the phone was great totay sealed and legit thank so much ! It was great
"I have had such a hard time with this phone.  I needed to replace an iPhone 8 Plus.  I bought it in February or March and it is now the end of August, and I am already looking for a new phone.  I dislike working without the home key (button).  You have to swipe all over the screen to leave a screen, etc.  The way it turns off is more difficult.  But those are just style preferences I could have gotten used to.  The real negatives are:  The phone crashes frequently.  Ive had trouble with the volume going out on GPS and several other functions.  Using Settings doesnt help.  The volume buttons wore out completely, and ceased to affect the volume, within a few months.  Positives:  I like how the slim profile makes it easier to hold, for taking ..."
"This iPhone works great and the price was very affordable too! I love it, it's been my favorite phone so far. It takes amazing photos, it's durable, and it's very easy to use. I've had it for about 7 months now and the battery still works amazing while using it everyday. It's stays charged for along time and the phone size is just about right for me, not too small or too large. I definitely recommend this iPhone. I put it's rankings with the more expensive newer iPhones, but this one is a lot cheaper and affordable and well worth the price!"
Picked out updated phones for parents. They were using Outdated Samsungs. Transition to iPhone went pretty easily. Easy set up with straight talk and easy for me to help them with any troubleshooting now that we all have iPhones. Got at Black Friday pricing.
"Awesome. Fast, long battery life, decent camera and graphics on screen. Only things that I didn't care for are that it doesn't include a wall charger (it is set up for wireless but it isn't included, either) and it doesn't have a fingerprint reader but has facial recognition which creates an issue when wearing a corona mask."
"Its a great phone! My only criticism is the Face ID feature. I miss the fingerprint identification that earlier versions had. Half the time I'll have to put my password in because the Face ID doesn't recognize me. But other than that minor inconvenience, I recommend."
"I live the phone I purchase, my only problem is that FedEx left my phone up the street two houses down and the neighbors said if I was you I would call and complain on FedEx. Walmart should End the contract with them. This is their 4time doing this to me. She said you lucky I'm not a roguish neighbor lol and gave me my package."
"First iPhone. Love it. Smaller than my note 10plus. Always wanted one. Even bought the hubby one to match. Different clear cases though for wireless charging. Works just like it is suppose to. Pictures are great. Sound is good. Connects tonbluetooth good, connects to iPad awesomely. Calls are clear. You get 4g lte with this phone not 5g. I can't think of anything bad to say about it. If so I'll update whenever."
"I got this phone a few months back because I like iMessage and iPhone used to have the smoothest OS. I also love the quality materials on Apple devices. But after 2 months I decided to sell it and here's why...

I'll start with the pros 
Excellent battery life 
Face ID and gestures work well
Nice bright screen 
Love the product red color

However, this phone is far from perfect. And i feel enough people don't point out the negatives in most reviews.

The cons
Screen freezes at times
Typing freezes I'll type 3 words before one shows up
Apps randomly close 
64 gb isn't enough storage for the update sizes
3 gb of RAM isn't enough 

So ultimately, this phone has really good and bad things. I got rid of it because I was very disappointed in how ..."
"Doesnt come with anything but a phone and a cord that has no charging block. 
My husband is lucky i have a iPhone to. 
Now he has to go get new headphones and a charger 
We thought like mine he would have gotten the block and headphones i got mine in store. Whats the difference from in store and online should be the same. Its the same price."
It came in good condition no scratches and works completely great 5 starts for sure!!
This is an amazing phone had no problems
Great phone great price - camera is ok
Works great so far. Size is good. Fits well in hand.
"I love it  , Came with sim card and easy to activate"
I got it as a Christmas gift at a good price
Took my money phone was sold to another customer
"Very easy to transfer info from old phone. Very clear, nice screen. Cool features!"
I LOVE this phone! Very happy with it! Soooo much better than the 7.
The phone shipped quickly and its perfect. The camera is insane
i do recommend this phone it is a good price and a great battery i had for like an hour and it was like on 98 percent of battery
PHONE OK BUT IT CAME IN A IPHONE 12 BOX  WITH A IPHONE 12 CHARGER AND THOSE BLOCKS COST LIKE 20 BUCKS SO IM NOT TO HAPPY ABOUT THAT
I do not like the XR i phone. Does not work as good as the i phone 6splus i had.  Also the face on the XR i phone is much smaller.
"My daughter absolutely loves this phone! We are ver satisfied with our purchase, I would recommend other shoppers to consider it!"
This is a great phone my phone has been at 100 all day and I have never charged it today overall I would recommend this phone if you need a upgrade that is cheap and on sale as of right now
"Very impressed with how fast it came, I'm not to disappointed that it doesn't come with headphones cuz I have my own, or a charger box cuz I can just use my regular iPhone charger until I go get the box. I love my new iPhone though."
shipping was fast! phone was new if not one step under it. battery life is good! dont charge it when you get it use it until it does then give it a charge.
"When i went to pickup this item i was told that it could not be activated, basically that the phone was broken. I am very upset as this was a gift for my stepson"
"Honestly, this phone was the perfect purchase for anyone looking to upgrade to a more recent cellphone. Prior to this, I was using an iPhone 6s that began overheating over time; I decided the XR was the way to go"
"I ordered the Iphone XR for my granddaughter, she loves the phone. And was easy set up to, also it came 3 days earlier then expected so she was able to have it before thanksgiving and shes very happy with her new iphone XR."
"Just went apple. I love the face recognition features. Easy to set up, and move my service over.  Has a option to move everything from your Android over."
Great phone good price easy to switch over since I already had Straight Talk nothing really bad to say other than they left it on my front step on my porch
"My grandson loves the phone, if we can only ever get it activated and on auto pay. This is a new phone - bought for Straight Talk, but it did not come with a SIM card. So if you order it be sure to order a card.  I just hope I got the correct one."
"It's a smart phone, haven't switched service (staying with the same 'pre-paid service) to it yet, but it's a major brand (Apple) so hopefully all should be well."
Only thing Im not a fan of is having to relearn how to navigate thought the phone from my older iPhone took about two weeks to get into the rhythm again
hi i dont like because in the wedside  say that you can used with family mobile and tried to work call family mobile is not work. also went i look on walmart online i put iphone xr this phone came in this page.
Phone came pretty fast! Ordered it Saturday got it Tuesday. However it didn't come with a box for the charger or headphones as I was expecting. But overall good shipping and nice phone for the price! Works great.
Love it!!!!! Only thing I didnt like was Walmart does transfer information from one straight talk phone to another!! But besides that the phone is great
Upgraded from a iPhone 6s plus and it's pretty much the same size! (Which I'm super happy about!) Got it on the AMAZING Black Friday deal. Phones fast and easy to transfer from old phone. Fast shipping too!! Happy customer!
I went from an iPhone 7 to the XR. The ease of information transfer is quick and easy. The more I use this XR model the more I like it. I am anxious to take some pics or videos.
The Liquid Retina display is BEAUTIFUL and pairs so well with the portrait mode included with the cameras. If you're looking for an upgrade I highly recommend the iPhone XR.
"This phone has needed to get reset every week so I can receive messages on people on android. This phone is the worst phone I've ever owned, and I'm a loyal apple fan."
"Considering Ive had a 6s for the last 5 years, when I saw the black Friday price of this phone, I immediately set a reminder alarm. I love my new phone, I dont want to put it down."
I bought this phone to replace my old Iphone 6s which needed constant charging.  I'm really impressed with the Iphone XR because it holds a charge for days!  The screen size is larger and I love the convenience of face recognition.
"So fat, I Love this phone! It transferred all my info from Android (except apps and passwords).  So easy to use. Slippery until I got a case, but now it charges wirelessly!"
"The iPhone XR is a nice phone, it came with everything except the wall charger, for the price of the phone a wall charger should have been included, its a 3 star for me"
um I guess people are unaware of apples change to try and help the environment box change that doesnt include charger or headphones but this is not walmarts problem its just apples
"so far, everything works good. it does not come with a charger box though. the charger it comes with is USB-C so you can't use a regular box, you have to buy one for that cable!"
"I absolutely love my new phone! I upgraded from a iPhone 6 and I have no complaints about my new iPhone XR. You can't beat straight talks proves, we have 3 iPhones in my household through STRAIGHT TALK!"
"I was worried about not having a home button, buuut omg I love it. The screen is so much bigger than my last phone and I love it. I love everything about it. The camera takes the clearest pictures I couldnt believe it"
The phone was great the delivery method (FedEx) not so great.  They told us they would be here one day and it was a no show.  Told us both by email and phone call.  Late the next day before they delivered.  UPS is the best carrier for out area
"This phone was brought brand new. Now it's glitching really bad. I'm not sure what's going on, haven't had any issues with the other iPhones we carry in our house."
"Fantastic upgrade from a 6S. Affordable upgrade with all the latest Apple features. Screen is larger, Ease of use easier without Home button. Great Upgrade without breaking the bank! The newest iPhone 12 has all the features of the XR."
Hello everyone if you wish to buy this phone I recommend it! It’s a nice and good find you must do theses procedures if you wish to make it a custom service like metro by T-Mobile or sprint A
This was one of the best prices on a newer iPhone. This is a gift for my mom who now loves it. She came from android phones and this is much easier for her to use. Great phone for everything.
Wonderful iPhone upgrade from 4s 5s 6s. Vastly improved camera. Seamless setup thru iCloud and Straight Talk. Fast processing and shipping thru Walmart.com. Arrived in pristine condition.  We love our walled garden:)
I am not an apple fan myself...but I bought this phone for the other 2 in my family that is. This is an extremely  nice phone and I must admit that the improvements that I  see in this ohone could change my mind about the apple phones.
Good phone I love it..... sept just for one thing it didn't came with the adaptor plug in and headphones but everything else came with...... so can't do to much complaining I love it.......
The phone is great so far but I didnt get a delivered notification until 2 days later and then on top on that they left my package on the sidewalk in front of my mailbox and thats unacceptable.
I like the phone it just could have came with a special plug to go with the special charger so I end up having to spend $27 on a special plug. Also I have to buy a special aux cord I wish I would have known before I bought the phone
"I would give this phone 5 stars, but I ordered the same phone a couple of days before this one and it had a charger adapter in it and headphones. This one didn't."
"We got the Xr for our son and its a great phone, he loves it and the proses was very good and fast 
we clicked the pay button and it was shipped and received it just be for Christmas.
it was easy and stress free thank you"
"Horrible purchase.  No headphones,  no chargee, no SIM CARD...eventhough you are forced to use straight talk for 12 months before going to another carrier. Called customer service and waited an hour to speak to someone. Finally got someone on the phone who offered to sale me the items."
My only problem with ordering this phone is everything was not including. The charger block and headphones were not included. I sent the phone back to get my items. When I received the next phone items were still missing. I called Walmart.com they gave me a credit to purchase missing items. This really was a big inconvenience to have to go through this. I do not understand whats going on why the items were not included. The one good thing is they gave me credit for missing items.
Well first of all didnt come with a wall adapter for the charger just the cord ?? Add said two day delivery but it took four days ! Overall phone works great ! But Im going to have to download a user manual also because didnt come with one of those either ! So need to learn how to use the phone also !! But for now the phone part works great once I was able to charge it !
No charging block no earphones nothing in description says you won't receive these items if that's the case it needs to be included in description. Was told to send phone back and I could get another one but that does me no good when I've switched everything over already. Also this phones battery does not seem to last as long as my 3 year old 8 plus I upgraded from.
"The phone itself is wonderful. Im a convert from Android. However, I ordered this as soon as it went on sale for the Black Friday specials. It came and to my surprise it was literally only the phone and a data transfer cord. My boyfriend ordered the same phone 3 days after mine and his came with a set of headphones, charging cord, and a wall block. I contacted Walmart and they are sending me a whole new phone to hopefully get it right this time. I only need the phone cord and wall block. I now get to go through the whole set up and transfer process over again when I get my new phone (which I still have no idea when it is coming). Great job, Walmart!"
"Walmart review

I ordered the Black iPhone XR 64GB on 11/19 around 8:30 AM. Walmart had initially told me the phone would arrive by 11/25, however, the phone was delivered on 11/23. The phone was shipped through FedEx, but they did not receive the shipping information from Walmart until the next day. I also want to note that I bought a refurbished iPhone SE (1st Gen) from Straight Talk in 2017 that ended up being unlocked and I was somewhat hopeful that this phone would be unlocked as well, it was not. The phone also arrived with the new Apple packaging, which just includes the iPhone XR, USB-C to Lightning Cable, SIM-eject tool, one Apple sticker, and paperwork that no one reads. 

Good day,

Hunter Ballad"
"my son broke his phone on Sunday afternoon. he was heading out on trucking run 2 hrs later and we were scrambling to find a used one to swap his service over to. but none of them worked.
so he decided to stop at local Walmart to buy a cheap phone to do until he got back and could change to a better one.
then, low and behold, he found this gem, with all of the bells and whistles, on sale for a 1/3 of the previous price.
the sales clerk was very helpful and soon he was trucking off thru the mountains, using his hands free service.
immediately  he noticed the difference with his phone quality and the straight talk service is so much better than his previous carrier as he's not dropping calls all over now!"
Well Ive been trying for 5 days to get my phone hooked up to my number in the mean time the 2 weeks pasted for making a return and Im stuck with a phone that the sims card cant be found whats up with that the number is not in the System Im burning up mad
"Absolutely one of my favorite phones i have ever owned. Coming from a person who drops their phone various times and it ends up being unfixable, i have gone through many phones but this just has got to be my favorite, if you are thinking about purchasing this phone, i %100 recommend that you do!"
I LOVE the phone. Hated how long delivery took. Was quote free two day delivery end quote
So far I love everything about it. I would recommend to anyone. And the sale price was awesome!
Seems to be working great!
works on wifi cant get it activated iv tried online and called said walmart didnt scan it correctly
I'm in love with this phone I came from a iPhone 6plus to an XR
I like the price and this is the most lower price Is wonderful
I love this phone. Its a great value for the money. I would highly recommend.
Liked the price and so far I really like the phone. Good battery.
I loved my phone it came early works great!
works like a charm super easy to set up great power life and is as advertised
Phone does not include adapter or ear buds.
Perfect condition came early best purchase I ever did
Its the same as every iPhone dont see anything different or better
Perfect phone didnt come with charging box or earbuds but still worth it
I didn't receive a charger . from my understanding I was told they know longer send a charger with the phone I have to buy my own charger.
So far I absolutely love my new phone for a wonderful price! I was worried about it but its amazing! You definitely will not regret.
Its a very nice phone it was worth every dollar spent but for crying out loud how come it didnt come with  a charging box
i love the phone no problems with it . It was very easy to transfer all my data no scratching came in great condition and even came a little early .
The battery does not last very long;  it has to be charged daily. My 8plus could go 2 or 3 days between charges.
Phone is in great shape. It didn't come with earphones or the adapter though. It came in the modern day iPhone 12 boxing
"Great purchase, phone came in brand new condition, it came with a charger but not a block. and no headphones other than that every thing was great"
"Got mine on sale for Black Friday and this phone is absolutely amazing. Upgraded from an iPhone 7, I love it!"
This was a black Friday purchase for my daughter. She loves it and I did too so much that I bought myself one too.
I ordered the phones that Friday morning n they actually came a day early on that Wednesday ... The phones work perfect!
perfect other than the charger doesn't come with a block but i mean the phone is everything it should be
"Very impressed with this phone.  Bought for my daughter for her birthday, and now it has me looking at getting one."
I couldn't even get it activated  with straight talk and I can't even get a refund. So now I'm stuck with a phone I can't even use.
"Bought this iPhone XR 64GB for my step daughter, she loves it, much better than her iPhone 8 she says."
The phone didn’t work at all and straight talk would not send a new one. They kept hanging up on me.
"Took a while to transfer my old phone over but well worth the wait.  More storage, bigger screen for watching videos and photos.  Great speaker."
Gift for adult daughter. She was wary of this iPhone but she is very happy with it. Its a nice upgrade for the money.
"The phone seemed to have arrived sealed, but upon opening it I noticed the screen has scuffs and deep scratches on it."
"It was perfect when it came , the phone didnt come with a box for the charger! I havent seen any problems as of yet !"
"does it really take a whole week for it to get here? It says In transit - On its way than In transit again like, really?"
"Has a large display, the color is very nice and the setup was easy. Arrived early which was great. I really like this phone and would recommend it !!"
I have never been an apple person but I really like this phone. It's easy to use and has a nice display. I like the face id also.
Love it! Safari is awesome. iPhone takes best pics. Dont like that it doesnt have wired headphone hole
it came with little or no instructions- also no sim card and a plug- so know that you will have to purchase that separately.....
Came 2 days earlier than expected. I'm so excited the phone is great  I'm really just excited to take pictures.
Works like a charm!   Better than I think as I am ignorant with technology of today.    I would purchase again if needed.
"I have had so much trouble out of this iPhone, Dropping calls, speaker is horrible, and I did buy a warranty with, some how it got lost…."
great purchasee i 100% recomend came new like absolutely new and with seal perfect definitely a great purchase walmart gets a happy customer
"So far so good. Had to update my phone as it was time. Not sure I like how big it is but phones seem to be getting bigger, so I guess I will deal."
"I got this phone for my twins and they love it, they were coming from a iphone 6plus, they say everything is better especially the camera."
"Works like a charm, I haven't activated yet but I've had it for a few days and everything works perfectly. No mic issues, and camera quality is good."
"Bought the $299 price I got it for, definitely worth it. Many of the features you love at an affordable price. Loving it"
My daughter loves it.  Apple products work for us. We love the security features and all other features.
"This phone has a lot of the features the newer iPhones but at a much cheaper price. Caught the Black Friday deal, cant beat it."
"My iPhone XR came in a iPhone 12 box.  No charger, block, and/or earplugs.  If I could give zero stars I would."
Nice phone..It was a Christmas Gift for my 9yr.old works fine no problems. The  price was great for this phone
I was never able to get the phone turned on because the people checking it out scanned the wrong code so it looks as though the phone was never purchased. $300 wasted
I haven't had this phone 6 months and it stopped working. Thought it was the battery so we took it to a cellular repair store and they told us the phone was no good. Worst phone I've ever purchased.
"I like the phone, but there was no charger, it had the wrong USB cable,  no charging port and no headphones.  I cant charge my phone nor can I listen to music."
Why isn't there a charging block???? You send a specific cord but not the other  piece to charge it with? Hmmm thanks for the phone but now I can't even use it
"phone looks nice, its heavier then the 7 i read some of the reviews about it coming with earpods mine didn't? am i missing parts i saw others comment about that but no reply??"
They gave me a default phone. It went on boot loop for days and i took it to the apple store to see if they could fix it and they couldn't!!! Wasted all that money so hopefully i get a refund!!!!!
came with a charger and a box and headphones. no scratches or anything. only bad thing was that it didn’t come with a thing to get the sim card out so i had to find another way around it :/. but overall a good phone considering how cheap it is.
I did not buy the phone yet but I am I was wondering do you got to actually purchase the straight talk card and the phone ? And do the phone come with a SIM card ?
amazing
"I like my new apple phone, except for one thing, everybody I don't know, calls me.  I get more calls from people who want to sell me something, 100% more than my old non apple phone.  And if I wanta add anything, I gotta buy it.  
My wife said she'd NEVER EVER buy an apple phone !"
"Great phone for the price. I live in rural area and straight talk works fine. Least expensive service I've found. I pay $34 for service   10GB of data.  It's funny all of the 1-star reviews are not even straight talk's fault. The customers say, ""no charger"" ""Walmart forgot to scan it so I can't activate it"" ""haven't received it yet because shipping"" ""it's not unlocked I paid full price"". Well if you're thinking about getting this phone take my advice so you don't be like them. Everyone knows Apple stopped sending chargers with older models I have like 10 in my junk drawer if you need one, buy the phone from straight talk direct on their website instead of Walmart, UPS is late often not just for iPhone deal with it, it says right in the desc..."
good phone but didn't come with block charger that's why I'm giving 4 stars
Big upgrade from the 6. Works very well and fast. I love full screen display.
love the phone. came in on time. recently just found out that it doesn't want to charge
I am happy with the phone great price
"I brought for my 13 year old cousin and he actually loved the phone, he upgraded from an iPhone 7"
Just getting use to iPhone period takes a little time
"Amazing , works perfect and the quality is outstanding, definitely worth the price and upgrade"
Been a long time since I purchased a new iPhone upgrade. Definitely not disappointed.

Straight Talk phones are awesome.  Love that I can get an iphone on the straight talk network.

Wish I didn't waste my time waiting for this phone I wanted to pick up
I got the phone a couple days than expected but the came without a charger and head phones.
My son wanted an iPhone so this was perfect for him.
Excellent purchaser and great price. Shipping was very fast as it came the next day.
It’s locked to Straight Talk. I was hoping it would work for AT
"bought for grandson for christmass,,was black friday deal but great phone"
"Love it, its an iphone. Does everything its supposed to do. Very happy with it"
"Its fast 
Its a great phone."
Very nice phone i love it

Great product brand new no problems good phone
The iPhone was shipped and arrived within 3 days of ordering. Great value. Satisfied customer.
It was great for it within 3 days! Has a lot of space and the battery last fairly long
Fast delivery and awesome price
Delayed. came without charger
I like the phone it's really nice. What recommendations that everyone should buy it
Cancel my iPhone that I needed
No charger block or headphones I had to purchase all of that
I love this phone just wish it had finger print security
My daughter loves this phone. She couldn't be any happier
camera quality is horrible do not recommend if like taking selfies
"My daughter loves the phone, but it is missing the charger. Make sure you check that all the components are there when you open the box."
This phone sucks. I'm one day into switching phones over and it's just a crappy iPhone. My iPhone 6 was way better. Go Samsung if you can.
Great phone for the price! Doesnt come with a block for the charger or earphones like the other iPhones Ive ever purchased
Did not come with charger plug or ear pods. Disappointing for the price. Also not stated anywhere on the description.
This phone is a contract phone. You have to use Straight talk or total wireless. Have fun getting them to unlock it to go to another company.
Phone was TWO days late other than that great quality great packaging and I overall love my purchase Truly recommend
"Great pricing for this phone. Its a Christmas gift for one of my children, So we havent opened it yet."
"All the money I paid for this phone, I didn't recieved a charger nor earpods. I wouldn't recommend buying from this company."
"I bought this phone during Black Friday in 2020, just traded it into Verizon, come to find out the BRAND NEW phone I bought in 2020.. is a refurbished phone. Not happy at all.."
I'm in love with this phone the best and most cheap
is there any way to unlock it from straittalk
"Does not come with headphones!!! Also, you are forced to use the phone with straight talk for 1 year before you can go to another carrier.  I am a healthcare worker, and straight talk does not work well in the hospital where I work. Just wasted $300"
"Got this phone on a back friday deal, so far it's great. Easy setup with Straight Talk, had to manually enter contacts/apps because I switched from android but I didn't mind..sometimes you transfer a lot of junk that way too. It's about the same size as my galaxy s7, almost got the SE but I'm used to the bigger screen and thought the SE would be too small. It's pretty easy to navigate, even without a home or back button. Face recognition is a neat and handy feature, wasn't sure if I'd like it but it makes opening the phone so much easier. The cloud storage"
"My son upgraded from an iPhone 6S and absolutely loves this phone! The price was great! Yes, it did not come with a charger block or ear buds. Which, I was a little disappointed with apple to not include those items. You can use a regular USB iPhone charger. Example: My son's old USB 6S iPhone charger can charge my iPhone 11 Pro Max and his new iPhone XR if needed. You are not limited to just USB-C or wireless chargers. I hope that info helps."
"I bought this iPhone XR - 64 GB - Black in store today 11/27/2020 and it came in an unopened box and with a pamphlet that said the phone is compatible with straight talk and total wireless. Upon opening and setting up the phone, I have Walmart Family Mobile SIM card and provider. I put my existing SIM from WFM and to my surprise, it works perfectly! Although it says straight talk and total wireless, I assume that this phone is unlocked due to the box stating that its CDMA, GSM, UMTS"
Absolutely the worst iPhone I've ever had. The 7 plus was much much better and the iPhone 4 I had decades ago was even better than the iPhone xr. I can't use the internet unless it's connected to wifi and I have the cellular data turned on. What a waste of time and money. I mean what's the point of paying $65 for the premium service if I can't fully use it?  Just another of many many many internet tech failures. I guess it's only as good as the people who create it.
It did not come with a charger or ear buds.
The phone did not work. I was never able to get it activated.
I did not have a charging block with this phone
"You can only use the company phone, not at@t"
"Super delayed, Cant get here on time"
Battery life not very good
"worst purchase ever, they won't even let me connect to my carrier and waste 3 hours"
Phone did not come with a charger or headphones very disappointing for the money
Phone wasn't properly scanned and won't activate…
Does not come with adapter or headphones
my grandkids are getting these for xmas. this was a great buy for this phone
Didn't come with wall adapter
Purchased this phone for my daughter for Christmas and the color went out 7 months later.
Does the iPhone XR update to iOS 16
The XR don't come with headphones??!!
didn't give me my sims card
"My IPhone XR Didn't Come With A Charger, Im Trying to Order A New One Idk What's Wrong With It"
"On the first day, first drop the screen cracked a little."
"Worst iPhone I've ever had. Cameras are awful, iPhone 11 is better."
"The phone is great, but the loan company that got put on there AFFIRM DO NOT GO THUR THEY ARE A RIP OFF THEY KEPT MY DOWN PAYMENT"
Straight Talk has the WORST service EVER. 3 hours on technical support over the last 2 days and they still can't get my phone to work. PICK ANYONE BUT STRAIGHT TALK!!!
Highly disappointed that the phone does not come with a charging block or a normal USB charging cord. It is basically useless until you purchase additional items especially if you are switching from an android.
"I think is great and I know my daughter will enjoy it when I buy another one for her, soon. I also  like the screen size and the overall size of the product.  I also think that it takes beautiful pictures and to see them and browse the web on that size of a screen is awesome. As I am getting older, my eyes are not what they used to be, and with a bigger screen it makes it a lot better to read and the color is beautiful."
"CAME BRAND NEW AND WITH A SIM CARD FOR EITHER STRAIGHT TALK OR TOTAL WIRELESS AND THE SET UP WAS SO SIMPLE,,,,, YOU JUST NEED TO BUY EITHER A STRAIGHT TALK CALLING CARD OR A TOTAL WIRELESS PREPAID CARD AND SUCH AN EASY SETUP,,,,, I HAD MINE WORKING WITHIN 5 MINUTES AFTER BUYING A PREPAID CALLING CARD,,,,,, THE PHONE IS BEAUTIFUL AND VERY FAST AND THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FROM START TO FINISH WAS GREAT,,,,,,"
I love my IPhone XR! It is a great phone on a budget and it works amazing! I switched from Android to IPhone and it has been very easy and user friendly!  This phone takes amazing photos and I will continue using this one until I can afford to upgrade!
Straight talk data speed borderline unusable. My old se with att worked better. Terrible customer service with straight talk. If you need to use apps or the internet Do Not Buy this phone. Basic pages with no audio or video won't even load often times. Google searches even take minutes. Very unhappy with purchase.
Been wanting a bigger iPhone since I got rid of my 6s plus for the iPhone 7 it’s a good phone but the screen size is way too small since I had gotten used to the 6s plus plus not to mention the XR is more modern and has a bigger screen along with an otter box to keep it from breaking
"This has been the worst experience/purchase from Walmart ever!! I purchased this phone on Black Friday and have spent two days trying to get the phone activated. Straight Talk reps keep saying the phone was not scanned properly at Walmart, however that is NOT the case. Took the original phone back to have it swapped out for another XR and we are still having the SAME PROBLEM with the second phone. (unable to activate). Straight Talk Reps.... please do not respond to this review with your common suggestion, which is to click the link for help, because I've spent countless hours on the phone with several different live representatives only to have nothing accomplished."
Overall it is a nice phone. Decent size. My only issue was it took awhile to download apps. First time using an iphone so I'm not sure if it's always like this. Made an apple id but then I had to sign into apple music and itunes before I was allowed to download actual apps. Other than that I love it. Would totally recommend.
"If you are someone who love to gripe and moan then I'm sure you would find something wrong with it, but I didn't. Looks awesome, fast, great pictures and service is awesome. I'm glad there's no headphone Jack. I like the notch cut-out. And for the money? No brainier."
I Purchase a brand new iPhone XR off of the Walmart website got the phone it doesnt  even seem brand new I seen small marks on phone and I was missing the phone charger block its self and I received no headphones I think they sold me a refurbished phone for the Black Friday deal I am not happy
This was a great first iPhone. This phone was in perfect condition. I had some problems connecting the wifi but it's all good. The wifi is all connected now. Doesn't come with headphones and it wasn't supposed to (check the description of product). Buy a separate wall piece block and buy an extra pair of apple headphones(APPLE ONLY **you'll thank me later**) Definitely buy it! It's worth it.
Straight talk changed there policy with out notice. Now you must stay with them for a year in order to get your phone unlocked on the phone that i paid for in full now they refuse and are charging 300 dollars to unlock phone ! Stay away from straight talk there costumers service is a joke!
"I loved my new phone. It was larger then my old one but still thin so it fits in my pocket. It seems to have the best qualities of the 7, 8 and 9. Making it a XR is the perfect combination. It's not super complicated but has all the perks of a more current phone. It even got my teenagers approval. The price made it something I could actually afford. It was $250. It was a great value for the money."
Phone is great love it but when I call straight talk to have an art sims through straight talk activated they tell me it’s powered through Verizon which is not disclaimed anywhere!!!! Now I can’t get service anywhere bc i can’t change my sims after I paid 600$ for 2 phones and 130$ for the byop sims kit
"The iPhone XR is awesome. Yes there is some cons for this but there are more pros. I have the iPhone XR too. Why I like it? Well for a incredibly cheap price, it's worth it. The cons are that the resolution is lower than 1080p and it has a lack of 3D Touch. Pros are that it's easy to set up, good battery, good calling quality, good speakers, and Face ID. So overall for 250-300$, it's worth the price."
"If you live in a rural area with limited carrier availability, DO NOT BUY A STRAIGHT TALK PHONE ONLINE.  The phone itself is great but my middle of nowhere town does not have Verizon towers and the phone that I was sent is locked to them.  Straight Talk reps are not very knowledgeable about their service, phones or even the activation process. Even though my phone CAN operate on the correct towers they say they can't switch it over until I complete 12 months of paid service... which I can't do since I can't activate the phone.  The superviser that I spoke with actually told me to just call Apple and they will switch the phone for an unlocked model or even unlock this one. After a long convo about the reasons and legalities of why Apple can'..."
Can i use my total wireless sim card and put in this locked straight talk iphone
"i really want this phone, but the 1 star comments are making me over think."
Who much is the taxes on the phone
Everything is perfect condition! No box or headphones but that's no problem
everything worked good. phones not as fast as a new one but it works
This phone was a terrible purchase.  It only lasted 5 months before it completely stopped working.
"Probably the worst price to performance ratio iPhone they ever made.
Screen is washed out due to using cheap panel
Camera quality is subpar due to having less lens than the premium model yet the price is not budget friendly at all"
"Phone worked great, and I really like it. It is way faster than my old iPhone. the size is perfect it's not too big nor too small. The gb are a perfect size to hold everything I need, probably more than I need. I definitely recommend this phone!"
Phone works really well everything is perfect but one thing is that it doesn't come with the c port charging brick for the phone so you only have a cord
This IPhone is Great I read the reviews and I was 15 seconds from not buying this product I highly recommend this IPhone and this might show up as a not verified purchase but I got the phone for early Christmas.
Bought this phone for my daughter to replace her iPhone 6 and she loves it. It's a more updated phone but she was able to still use all her cases from her 6.
Does it come with an activation card because I was thinking about ordering the xr on Straight talk and how do you activate it without a red activation card.
The phone is great but for some reason every apple phone I purchase at Walmart they do not activate it correctly so I have to return to the store to with so far 3 apple phones ridiculous I am truly fed up
This is not a phone that is securely wrapped in a box. It is not put in a Apple box. This company is out of Florida. It looks refurbished although not stated.
What service towers does the XR run off of? I can not get  a straight answer if it is Verizon or not. I need to know before I purchase it. I know it is Straight Talk but different Straight Talk phones run off of different towers.
"i'm not sure, but after reading a couple of ratings.. it's kinda like winning the lottery or a couple of these people are to dumb to realize the problems that came with this phone.. i'm
a bit skeptical of buying this product."
Do not buy a straight talk phone! The phone is locked to straight talk and you have to pay to unlock it once you find out all the data breaches that are happening and have to deal with the horrible customer service.
I like the phone but what I disliked was the carrier Straight talk the representatives don't know what they doing there it took me a week to get my number transferred to this company.
"Nice phone but for some reason I can't get it activated, it should be easy and not at all difficult but for some reason Straight Talk cant activate this phone"
Pain in the butt to set up. Three people probably had six hours  in trying to set it up. Straight talk support didn't help any. Can't understand them. Finally got it set up. The phone works great.
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE WORLD. If you EVER have a problem with your service, may God help you, because StraighTalk WON'T. I called for tech support (in Cambodia? Pakistan? who knows?)"
It was hard at first to get used to. Going from a 7 plus to an XR is really different. But I really like it now that I've had it for awhile. Would give it an 8 out of 10.
"Quick delivery. Battery life was 100% when I got it, now 2 months later battery life is 97% !!  Would not buy this phone again !!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST !!!!"
Terrible purchase. Phone doesn't work. Been on hold for at least 4 hours throughout the day. Keep getting bounced around from one person to the next. Leaving straight talk after this experience.
The phone is great I got this phone because my 6s plus broke and I have had it for a day.one bad thing is the charger but I have a computer I plug it into . It's brand new and I love it
I had gotten an IPhone XR back in December of 2020 and it started seeing black lines witch WAS NOT from being dropped. I had gone back and got a new one same phone and paid out of pocket for it. I didnt even have that one of for more then an hour and then black lines came up on that one. That next day I got a new one witch is what Im on now and black lines are showing up now. This is the 3RD ONE and Im still having this issues and the most they are willing to do is just give money back. Now I cant even return this one Because  of the 15 days being up.
"This iPhone is being advertised as a BLACK FRIDAY DEAL. It was less the beginning of the week and week before than it is now!! !!
That makes NO SENSE!!!! I was going to purchase it today, but price went up. So I will not be Purchasing and am checking around on carries after this. Poor Business"
I love my XR . It was affordable and I love the features
I love it I got it black and I love the size
If I knew this item wouldn't be available to pick up like it said it was then I wouldn't have spend $300 and something for it.
"Didnt come with a earphones nor charger adapter only the usb
But otherwise its 100% new and delivery came on time"
Very good price! Got it before Christmas so haven't used yet. My wife already has one and she loves it.
"I love it and my baby loves it too, came new in the box ! I would recommend get this I'm glad i went with the prepaid instead of the used phones"
I like the fact that it comes quick I was scared because I thought that it there was going to be scratched up but I was wrong
"Expect to pay 300  if you go in store, they don't price match like they used to, 250 on rollback but still 320 in store"
I love my new phone but it did not come with a charger block or the earbuds but i still loved my phone. Plus it had no cracks or scratches.
Does not come with headphones or a charger. Seems decent enough though in regards to its operation. Camera works well
There's nothing I didn't like about it just the fact I didn't arrive when it was supposed to do to delaying.
Bought for my sons 15th birthday. It won't pick up wi-fi in his bedroom. His 6s works great in his room. Disappointed with the XR
This is NOT a Black Friday special!! It's been $299 forever! Knock off $50 at least for Black Friday!
"Phones great no problems love it,For the price I would buy another one but the phone still doin good so no  need"
Bought this for my 10 year old for Xmas. Activation with straight talk was super easy. He's going to love it.
I've had the phone for about a month now and it freezes very often and get hot kinda fast other than that I love it
"So much better then the 6s. Everything is better quality, holds more space. It works faster. Only downside is no home button ."
"Why do you ask for a review this time of the year? When we make a purchase this time of the year, it's a good bet that it's a Christmas present."
I love it I got the black one and it's cute only has the charging cable doesn't come with the white cube
"I haven't gotten the phone, just wanna know can I connect it to any carrier???"
Great phone. Happy with this purchase
Best purchase everrrrr no water damage good battery and over all a great phone
Very easy to set up good quaility
Nice so far work perfect and great price
Great specs. Greaat product!
Are these new or used? The reviews say used but the item itself says new?
One of the best iPhones ever! Great battery! Great camera! Great price!
It's an iPhone. We all know what it's for. It works until Apple decides it doesn't.
Photos could be a little better but overall a great phone
I love my phone it's perfect
Can I use a different cellular provider such as Verizon phone f I get this phone
Who is the carrier for this phone? Verizon or AT
"I like the bigger screen, the better camera, and the more up to date apps."
"Arrived as described, sooner than expected, cheaper than competitors."
The phone has been glitching since I got it. Not satisfied.
When will the other colors be restock !!
The phone was exactly what's shown in the picture. My son love it!
I just like the whole phone

I don't like that I paid $300 for a phone that doesn't have a charger or headphones
I did not but this product my parents did it is a really good phone
"I was going to order this phone online, but i saw all the comments about items missing in the box. I went in store and purchased, get home"
Is there any way to get this unlocked???
"Do an Internet search. TCL TVs are horrible! The back light in mine went out in less than three years. I have seen many reviews where the back lights went out. Some within a year! I have never in my entire lifetime had a single TV that lost its back light. I called TCL support and they said it is not worth having it fixed. If you do get one of these TVs, you might want to get insurance on it."
"Simple, Clean, Straight forward, works out of the box. Connect to internet, update,restart, login to Roku account and done ! 5 minute setup Quick Easy and Painless.

*Has Game Mode to remove Input Lag for anyone interested*

Also the store delivered the same day! 5 Stars!"
Cheaply made tv. It only has two screws on one side and three small and fragile clips on the other holding the back plate on for a wall mount. Mine broke after only 5 weeks. Walmart refuses to accept a return and was told to contact the manufacturer. I did and TCL stated that their one year warranty doesn't cover physical damages. Their suggestion is tp use the legs. If I wanted to put it on a counter I would never have used an adjustable wall mount. So now I'm out 120 dollars thanks to retailers and companies not standing by their products. So beware if you buy this product and it breaks neither walmart or the manufacturer will help you. You will just lose hard earned money. Which is a shame because it really has a nice picture and was rea...
"The Apple Music did not work and it occasionally turned very dark where you had to use a flashlight to see the words. I tried resetting the tv and plugging it out/back in, turning the tv brightness up but it would only go back to its normal color after a couple hours. Otherwise, everything else was fine."
"Received the TV fast, placed on the wall mounting, TV did not work! returned it to the store."
"Great TV. Sharp, clear picture. Decent sound. The ROKU smart features make it very easy to use."

The picture isnt perfect but its a good tv for a kids bedroom or guest room.
"Purchased for my Granddaughter.
She loves the TV that has all the features
Good price for the TV"
TV works great and the remote is newer it has disney   on it now :)
The first tv I purchased had a messed up screen. It was brand new and never out of the box. It looked fine until I plugged it in. Just make sure you plug it in first if you are giving it as a gift. I made that mistake. I was able to easily exchange it and the new one works great. My mom will love Roku once she gets internet.
I bought this TV for my small spare bedroom for guests when they stay.  Very easy to set up and get working.  I recommend any Roku based TV as they have become the way we watch anything now.  I ended putting this TV in my bedroom and my old (bigger) TV into the spare room as the picture is better on the TCL.  I will be buying more TLC TVs in the future.  They are very good for the price.
"Yes, this is a newer model. That shouldn't make you hesitant to try. The bad reviews are mostly from those who damage their own products, have rowdy children that are disobedient who break things and lie about it. Just like anything else, if it is hit or exposed to things not meant for electronic devices, it will definitely cause damage to your device. Also, if you leave any electronic device on without allowing it to rest and reboot on a daily and nightly basis will eventually fail. If you take proper care of your device, you too will be able to write a good review on your new device. Want to be satisfied with your new or future purchase? Then take proper care of it and it will work like it was meant too."
I bought one of these televisions in store only to take it home to see the screen doesn't work. After exchanging this set for another in store I take the second tv home to find that the screen is all black once again. I am disappointed this product is whack.
Would like to let you know if you intend to use Roku its now charging aâone time chargeâ fee of $99 for you to stream your other channels such as netflix and hulu. So tack on an extra hundred for this tv. I am returning mine and getting one that doesnt use Roku. Buyer beware!!!
"I thought I'd save myself some money and get this TV, as I was going to get a Roku stick for it anyways. Big mistake. This tv never wants to connect to my wireless network. I can't use anything without the internet. Piece of garbage. Wish I never bought it. I'm only giving two stars because when it chooses to work, I do like it."
"This tv is very hard to set up. I had to contact manufacturer and my cable company. Manufacturer was no help at all.  Cable company had to send out a tech. Finally got it up and running. 
Don't buy unless u r very tech savvy.  
Picture and sound are very good. Very small remote."
"last night we bought tv for our daughter's room. As soon we arrived home from Walmart to set tv up, somehow the screen light half broken. Disappoint."
"I'm very unhappy with this Tv, Hardly any Volume,Sound to it have to turn volume all the way up still not very loud at all…."
My TV fell down and broke by itself without me touching it
Perfect size for room. Love it being a smart tv
works as advertised at a great price
they gave it to my lil sister it's great
NO Backlit Remote !!!!  in 2023 ??? smh one corner Roku should not cut
The driver was nice and courteous. Everything was good.
The remote does not have a microphonw so it is difficult to change channels.Not easy to set up
i love this t.v omg it is perfect
I liked that I was able to get a tv at such an awesome price.
dislike the fact that it cuts on and off in the middle of me watching something.
i bought a 32 and a 50 inch of this brand and within 2 years all i got was sound and a black screen on both. there junk
"Absolutely satisfied, I’ve had my TV since 2016 and I haven’t had any issues with it! Definitely recommended!"
thank you so very very much my Walmart family I love you guys happy holidays I am so happy thank you
It keeps asking for a USB and won’t allow us to watch anything or download streaming app!!! Tv is crap
"Here it is 2022 , This TV has worked great so far but I believe it’s finally starting to give it. I purchased this tv in April of 2020"
"Why was I charged $128.00 for a black Friday deal that was supposed to be $ 98.00? I tried to cancel it, but I guess it didn't happen?"
What I like of it is the color an sound I have a 55 inches in my living room for more then 5 years an it never gave me problem I love it
password to get in 1236 it wasn't excepted by my son Javar . i sent it to him. He said it couldnt be excepted by him
"for 120.oo its hard to beat
 my home was hit by lighting and needed one for my bedroom
 picture was better then expected
if needed id buy another one
negative 
no sleep timer
lil slow, i spent a 120.oo, i figured that"
simple to hook up. picture quality is great. no problems with the streaming services but have an indoor antenna which pixalates whenever someboby walks nearby.  overall i give it a 5 star rating
Price adv  $ 99.00 Put it in cart went up to $124.00then wanted to add 3Yr warranty $10 price showed $13  Sale then went Through before adding warranty without my verifying saie
"Love this TV, this is my 3rd one purchased, one for each bedroom! They are inexpensive, can put all my apps in one screen, and only weights 8 pounds so easy to mount if you have small spaces."
Just purchased my first Roku TV and liking it so far. I had tried many types and found this one to be easy to set up. The picture is great and sound not so bad.
"Great value…. We bought one for each bedroom and 5 years later, 2 out of 3 are perfect, but the one we use the most seems to be slowing down and top 1/4 of screen is getting dark. I still feel as tho we more than got our money’s worth."
"the drive was great we were informed that the package was at are home and unfortunately we were not. but we were called and we told her were to put the package and it was there when we got home. 
thanks."
DO NOT BUY! Bought our TV late 2019 and two years later it had vertical lines and flickering picture. It lasted two years!? Philips service no help and said buy a new one. It won't be a philips that's for sure!
"TV worked great for a little over a year (of course right outside of any warrarnty) and then the backlight died and its useless now. Gave 2 stars, because it had a very user friendly interface and beautiful picture when it did work."
Bought this tv maybe a year ago and have used it a handful of times and it black screened. Have tried multiple things to fix it but it believe it’s shot. You get what you pay for
Perfect size for my room. And easy set up
I bought the tv and now it cracked and damaged
The price was great! Set up was easy!
love it. very sharp picture
The quality picture isn't that good!!!
liked her alot. was very helpful.  helped me use the tv. great job
"Great tv, picture, sound and quick delivery. Easy set up.. GREAT price!!"
This TV is a perfect fit for the bedroom.  The TV has a clear and beautiful picture. It is easy to use and easy to navigate.  The Apps are easy to fine and download.
Bought this tv for my niece for Christmas 19 already broken it is March 20 barely 4 months completely quit working. Probably won't be able to get it replaced either thanks Walmart tcl
Just bought this two days ago and just now watch the screen slowly dim to black and now I have three big fat lines in the screen and that's it. I do have another TCL and it has worked fine but I will be taking this one back.
I think it's funny how you will do cracked screens on cell phones which cost as much as a TV but you will not do it on the TV is very unsatisfied with this plane very
I love this TV !!!! Only 720O but the picture is crisp and clear! I've purchased 3 to place in every bedroom. Easy to navigate and the a nice variety of   streaming channels. The remote battery life is long!
awesome
"I have had this tv for a week now and Iâm really pleased with it. I first got the Visio but it wasnât a Roku tv so the only way to watch Spectrum cable was to cast from my tablet and that was a pain actually. This tv has roku and the spectrum app is easy to navigate, access favorites, on demand etc. It has a roku remote just like the one you get with a roku streaming device which is the simplest remote you can get with anything these days which is good for the most part the most obvious flaw is there are no volume buttons. That is fine for the streaming device since the tv its connected to has a remote with volume buttons but when there is no other remote you are stuck negotiating menus to find volume adjustment and all i found was pres..."
"I bought Roku units specifically because they offer the Spectrum App. Yesterday, my Spectrum App failed to load as it does from time to time, so I tried to delete and reinstall (this usually fixes the problem). The Spectrum app has disappeared from the Roku channel menu. I reached out to Roku, who absurdly told me to call Spectrum! Last time I checked, Spectrum doesn't run Roku software. If you need Spectrum, DO NOT BUY ROKU."
Read good reviews for this TV so I bought it. I've previously had 1080p TV's and even though this one is only 720p I see no difference in the picture. The roku is amazing and I have only had the TV a week but it is amazing so far 10 fold worth the money!
"This tv isn’t even a year old and it’s powering off, acting as though someone is pushing random buttons. Turns on randomly in the middle of the night. It’s been going on for about a month now. I did a factory restart. Helped for about 2 days then started again. I want a replacement tv."
I originally planned on purchasing a 50â smart tv for $300 untill I came across this 32â for $124- $130 after tax. Its light enough to carry which worked out for me because i am a 5â0 female. Smart tv pre-equipped with apps saves lots of money versus buying a roku device or firestick seperate and who needs cable now days?!!  My only complaint is the manual advertised a cable adaptor but i did not find that in the box which was completly new And sealed(strange) a little disappointed. Overall I am pleased with this tv comes with a remote and batteries picture and sound quality are superb!!
"If you're like me, you are wondering wth ROKU is and whether you have to pay for it. The answer is that it's a service that filters content that you watch from other streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc. and shows you relevant movies and TV shows from those streaming services and others as well as from live TV.  It also shows you rentals available. It isn't bad, but it is different. You can have all the apps you'd expect like the ones mentioned above and YouTube, Spotify, HBO go, Showtime, and everything you could possibly think of.\n\nThe TV is decent quality. The sound is poor without a soundbar. Also, if you're in a dorm room or over a Wifi connection that requires both a username and password, you might need a workar..."
"I am using this with an antenna and it works fine.  The Roku is easy to use.   I wanted to see if I could ""cut the cord"" after losing CBS on Direct-TV.  Warning - unless you are on top of the transmitter, CBS will not pick up - they appear to be ""Jamming"" the signal to get us to pay for CBS-All Access."
"This tv is really awesome. I have it in my bedroom and it is the perfect size. I paired it with a little google nest assistant thing that I got for my birthday and it's great. I had heard there had been some issues with this brand and pairing things bluetooth,  my nest does say that the tv is unavailable from time to time but that's usually when my wifi is being crazy too so whether or not that is related, I just sort of chalk it up to that. Otherwise this tv is great. I run Netflix and Hulu off of the Smart TVs apps and then I also have a PS4 set up and the gaming is decent. I would totally buy this again. it's worth the purchase!"
Got this tv for my kids room and indont  regret buying .its a 10-15 min setting up the tv ..the free channels ect .but its worth it .connect to mobile hotspot just fine .lots and lots of free movies and shows .gives you option to dowload more apps too .i would reccomend !
My son and daughter gave me a 55 in TLC and I have had this TV for 4 years and is working great so last year I bought a 32 in and it is a great TV.  They have the same  32 in on sale and I  am going buy it for another  bedroom.  It is a great TV buy it
I love this TV. We had always bought visio then we came across this TV. We decided to give it a try and had 90 to take it back if we don't like it. Excellent picture and sound. This was a great buy. If lightning strikes again we will buy another TCL TV. We love this tv.
"I chose this television as a replacement for one of similar size. It weighs a fraction of our old set. The video is crisp, black is black and white is white. I love the built in Roku feature and setup was a breeze. I'm pleased with the purchase and the price was right."
"Never buy this company tvs 
I claimed non working tv in warranty in 3 months and they sent me broken screen tv again 
Now i am asking for full refund but by calling every single day they telling me that i am going to submit your case to our headqarters and wait for approval 
Nothing happning from last 7 days 
Out of tv since a month 
Still waiting 
If you like to wait then only buy this tv 
Good luck to all of you out there 
Pay little more and get good company tv which can replace your tv if anything happen"
I use a antenna and had a Roku box.  I almost put this back in the box without even trying it when I saw the remote.  But I read the directions and understood but still not convinced. I hooked my antenna up and plugged it in and turned it on.  Roku sets up first. After that all I had to do was click antenna and it took off scanned for all channels and I was ready to go.  Easiest setup I have ever seen.   And the remote once you use it its easy.
"I have had my TV for over 2 years now it's an awesome TV it's better than my 55in Sony, I wish I could trade that in for a TCL. I am buying anther TCL soon for my room. 

Also all of these bad ratings because of a supposable fee's,  that is a scam, those people were scammed,  there is no charge for your Roku TV. They got a hold of  a scam site, which there is quite a few trying to get your information telling you, that when you hook up your Roku TV that you're going to need some sort of fee which is not true. they have reached a scam web site. So no worries on fees. but beware!!"
"awesome little tv. easy to setup and hardly even buffers, even the one in the garage. my daughter has one in her room and I'm getting another for my other daughter due to a short in her HDMI in her Element tv. the only issue i have is that sometimes the remote acts funny as in non responsive, but this is on the older set of the 2 (2017), but other than that, these sets are great for the price."
"Very upset with this purchase. I hooked the TV up and was prompted to put my email address in, which I did, and received a code via email to put in TV. I put the code in and was prompted to call technical support. I called and was greeted, given product information, and then told that I needed to pay a one-time fee of $79.99!  I said I didn't want to pay a fee to use a TV I just paid for and was told I had to pay the fee to set up my TV!  This is outrageous and should be illegal!"
"Next time I will check the remote!  I have to stand in front of the tv and point the remote at the very small  receiver and hope I only have to select 30 times!  It is the location and size of the receiver!  Curious, why all these TVs have the speaker in the back!"
"Continuously disconnects from  wireless WiFi, every couple of months I have to reset to factory setting. It takes about an hour for all the apps to load again.  No other device does that in my house, so I know its not internet. Warning ⚠️ please don't waste your money!!!"
"I waited 2 years to write his review. These tvs are truly awesome and have outlived my Visio and a Samsung we purchased. I didn't expect that to happen but it has. They were brought by Santa for my 11 and 12 year old BOYS. The price was right. The boys watch movies and game on them via PlayStation and Nintento systems. The games are gorgeous on them. I am able to run HULU and NETFLIX with no additional hardware or sticks or whatever. I run Direct tv through them both both kids also have a dvd players attached.  ALOT happening and the tv handles it all. It was easy for my 11 year old to navigate and use. It has timers and parental locks....great clarity and sound. Most of all, great price. The screen is plenty big for a standard size bedroom..."
"I owned this tv for about three weeks. During the first week, it had a hard time connecting to my internet Wi-Fi signal every time I turned it on, so I had to go through a manual connection each time. Then, after it had been on for about three hours or so, the screen would just go black and the tv appeared to have shut off. But it would come back on after half an hour or so, stay on for a while and then shut off again. I thought that this was a Wi-Fi connection problem. During the second week, I compared the sporadic tv shutdowns to my laptop operation. I would tune in the same show on both devices and observe whether the laptop blinked or shut off when the tv did. So, no, that didn't happen. The tv would just shut down, stay off for a whil..."
"I would give 4.5 stars. Gorgeous picture, roku works great, parental controls are fantastic (my 10yo daughter purchased this with her birthday and Christmas money), the picture is beautiful...I can't say enough good things. The only thing I wish was different is that it only has 5 brightness settings. I want to turn it down lower (less bright) than the “darker” setting but that's not an option. 10/10 would recommend!!!"
"I have really been impressed with the picture quality of this tv. The sound is a bit on the low volume side but I have a sound bar to remedy that. Itâs not bad I just like the surround sound from my tvs. Still havenât figured out how to use the sound bar on the tv itself for apps probobly put the cables in the wrong place. Overall, Iâve really been enjoying my new tv and would definately recommend it for a small to medium room. I think the remote control has a dedign flaw because the slightest touch on the side of the remote will shut it off. Just gotta be more careful when using it. Definately satisfied."
"This is a great TV, but you need to make sure you follow the instructions in the manual when activating Roku.  I initially tried to follow the information on the screen and went directly to a scam asking for a $200 fee for activation.  Don't fall for it!  Roku is free and it is a great system.  Unfortunately, after one day of use, I bumped into the TV and broke the TV.  This does not take anything away from the great system you get with this TV."
"I will start of by saying that I'm very impressed with this TCL TV! It has very clear video and Great sound, Which is a plus! This product was very easy to setup and navigate. The TV is a 32 inch, I love the size. It's perfect for any sized room. I love that it's not heavy and light in weight in my opinion. I would recommend."
Unable to access LOCAL TV stations.  I could get Antenna TV stations only. I called TCL for help.  After many attempts of loading channels - still - nothing.  TCL advised loading between 8pm and 10pm. Still no luck.  Called Comcast.  They said if I bought a TV starting with a 5 or 6 series they may have a solution but they where unable to help either.  I will return and purchase the TV and Ruko SEPARATELY.  Finally - there is a cable box displayed on exterior of the box but NO cable box on the Home screen.
"The only problem with this tv is the volume is very low even with my surround sound it's still low but other then that this was a back up tv since my other TCL 32"" Roku tv got broke during my moving into my new place so I will be replacing this tv asap with another TCL 43"" 4K HDR tv I saw in stores"
"Don't get me wrong this is a great deal, beautiful picture, built in Roku, everything you could want except the sound. As, I have this in my bedroom and often listen to it on headphones,  I have no issue.  If you want this in your living room, buy a sound bar. Out of the box the sound is terrible,  it sounds crackly."
I love the TV . I also hope this gets to the right person I went in and went to the pick up the TV and the area was closed I went to the customer service dept and this gentleman up there helped me and went back to the back got my TV and brought it to me . That was amazing I was so happy . People like that needs to be in customer service.
I got this TV about 2 years ago and loved it never had a problem. Now my TV will not stay connected to my WiFi box and I have to keep unplugging it from the wall/ turning the TV off for it to connect to the internet. I have updated/reset my TV and it still does not stay connected and it doesn't do it all the time just occasionally.
"it was a decent tv until I bumped the table it was on.  then a nice full screen crack was on the screen when the tv hit the corner of the table.  they need to have a wider base instead of the 2 skinny legs the tv comes with. 
not vary stable. currently looking for a wider base"
"This is, by far the worst time I've ever had creating an account with anyone. Also, if you don't haven account, you cannot even use this as a regular TV, a computer monitor or be able to screen cast...the things Roku doesn't tell you. For all I know, even with an account, if I can ever get one, you cannot do all those things I just mentioned unless you are on the internet, making the unit useless in many cases. Also, if the ""smart"" part breaks down, I don't believe the TV can be used at all. This is geared towards Roku services, not the customer.

I kept getting a password not correct when submitting a new account. I go back as instructed to fix the highlighted field/the password, and in red is stated ""you could use letters, numbers and sym..."
"I purchased my first TCL two years ago and I'm very happy with it......but this recent purchase was a nightmare.

After 2 weeks horizontal lines appeared on screen. I read online this was common in the newer models have put out. I believe the quality has gone down a bit since my first purchase.

This TV was unboxed and moved to room it was purchased for. I've handled my first TCL way move than this and it's lasted 2 years. Honestly even the remote feels lighter and cheaper."
I bought two of these TVs.. unluckily the Second tv that I purchased I had to not only return once but A total of 3x.. This is Great but Everyone I've opened since then has been crack and or has missing pieces. I'm at my wit's end with trying to find a good one. frustrating as it is this is the perfect tv for my 5year old. only if I can get another without having issues straight out the box.
"I bought this TV before moving into my current apartment and I've loved having it. The TV is easy to use and comes with a stand, but it can also just stand up on it's own if you don't feel like putting it on. The TV comes with Roku which is really simple to navigate and keeps all of your apps close by and easy to find. 
One complaint I would have is switching between HDMI ports. Whenever you want to switch from, say, Netflix to your connected PS4, the TV does take a second to recognize that something connected to the HDMI is turned on, but other than that, I really enjoy this TV. The picture and sound quality are great and it comes with a great built in system that seems to have everything you would ever need."
"This tv is awesome! It is extremely light weight. I bought it for my 4 year old son's room. The best thing is that you don't have to have a cable box or even cable in order to enjoy this tv. The remote is a Roku remote. You have access to tons of free channels of entertainment because it's powered by Roku. You can watch YouTube, Prime TV. Tons of free kids shows! I am extremely pleased!"
loved the tv worked great no issue put high up on the wall the first day we got it out of the box so nothing can hit it. all of a sudde volume stoped working and of course I cant do anything about it because I bought it october worked fime for just over 3 months and now its having issues sorry but ny last tv lasted 5 years not 3months!!!!! very angry I dont have cash to replace it I have 2 kids to think about! fix your stuff!!!!!!!
"Picture is excellent, sound is low and tinny but about what you'd expect from a small flat-screen - sounds great with a cheap sound bar. My problem is that the analog inputs don't work at all - it won't detect any signal from a game console or old DVD player connected to the coax or A/V inputs even though those devices work with other TVs. So the only usable inputs on this TV are HDMI."
Bought this TV about 6 months ago and only occasionally use it. I noticed about a month ago that the sound quality has become terrible. It sounds like the speakers are blown out and it buzzes even though it has never been turned up past 15 on the volume. I contacted TCL warranty center and they sent me box to send it to be repaired. I just received the tv back from ârepairsâ today and there is no change in sound quality. Spend the extra to buy a higher quality brand since what I saved in buying this cheap tv Ill have to spend on external speakers.
"I read most of the responses for a product before i buy , that said i will return the favor for somene else. I needed a TV for our bedroom as we are getting older and need  quiet noise to fall asleep. we purchased a TLC , TCL(or something like that) with Roku installed. Best decision i made with picking a TV, The trouble is that the cheaper priced ones were built in 2018 or before and i was corn fused as to whether i was about to purchase a set that was not updated. So i just bought the newest and moderately priced TV after reading the remarks. and i was greatly satisfied with the price and the delivery from Walmart. Hope this helps you decide.
Sincerely,
JFMc, Pittsburgh"
Returned the led wrong size putt i need 43 inch
Great picture and the size is perfect for the room
delivery of item was as expected! great work!
fell over on accident and broke after 2 weeks of having it in the home:(
Got this for the kids. Works pretty good for them and very easy to use.
Want last and TCL will not cover it. Buyer beware
No remote no legs in box with tv
The service was amazing thank you so much
"It's easy to purchase but I dont like the hours of pickup, It's too late to pickup the items."
Ordered and delivered on the same day. And it works perfectly. Super happy
It works just fine and the right size for office space
Like the price of the TV was so reasonable
I do no have a chance to do a return but the tv came damaged
Great price! And received really fast!
Does not support HBO Max.  Clearly no effort being made to support all services
I did not purchase a TV!!!
VERY BEAUTIFUL. I HAVE BUYED THIS PRODUCT AND I WANT TO BUY IT AGAIN
"Great curbside service, thank you!"
Love it! Perfect for my kids rooms
You practically have to stand on you head to use the remote
"my TV came with the hox torned, the driver put it in my door so I couldn't see it was torn..."
"Easy setup, good color.  Nice TV for the money.  We'll see how long it lasts."
I have the older 32s321 tcl. Had it for almost 3 years now and still works just fine
Did. It have product and didn’t return my money for it
bought a tv came without a remote or legs. nice job walmart!
Thank God for the television
love it! so easy and convenient
My tv look like the size of 24 inch does not look like my other 32 inch
My TV is only 1 year old and the speakers have gone out already.   DO NOT BUY THIS TV.
I need information about this items
Do not purchase my TV didn't last a year stop working. Starting turning on and off by itself .
This TV is perfect to just set up on your coffee table and enjoy! it’s super streamline and straightforward and a great addition to our electronics!
"Miss leading as to what I was purchasing, needed a mount not someone to install it. And no refund available is not good customer service"
"I want to tell y'all that if you cant bring the TV tonite, that:s fine. Im waiting on the ice cream mostly tonite."
"Love my 32"" roku tv. It has a great pucture and sound. Perfect for my bedroom, it has everything I need. Great quality"
Why was my order cancelled you had my credit card number address and everything so what was the problem
"Great price, but poor quality!  The image is very poor and fussy, the volume doesn't work half the time.  Pay a little more for a better TV."
I've only had the tv for a month but I have no issues. The color looks great and the setup was simple.
"This is the 4th TCL TV I’ve purchased, they all work great and are easy to use.  Great picture and cost effective."
The sound from the TV set is absolutely horrible. Totally unlistenable.  TCL support was nonexistent. I will return it at the first opportunity.
Just bought this tv tonight and will be returning it tomorrow. The remote is so slow and you practically have be standing right in front of the tv to even move the cursor
I though this tv was good but only two months later the picture started flashing with colors highlighting the people as they move across the screen I am so disappointed...
Would really like the nuumber put on rhe remote my huband likes to switch channels going back and forth so he hates it because of that!!!! Otherwise I love it!!!!
"This would be a great TV; however, even with the volume on 100 - we can hardly hear it. It's a poor design because the speakers on facing down on the bottom of the TV. So, the volume goes down instead of out."
"This is such an amazing tv for the price.  its 32 inches and it has wonderful apps on it. It's easy to set up, and sign into whatever apps you have that the tv has. I'd so recommend it. especially for the price!"
do not waste your money on this piece of junk TV it was 3 months old when it's got lines across the screen. thank goodness it was still under warranty they replaced it with a used one a screw TCL I still haven't even opened it yet it's in the closet
I purchased this same tv but I paid 150 for mine  it started off a great tv now when I turn it on it's rolling fast cutting off and on by itself So I unplug it like for 7 days it was fine after 1 day then started back doing what it wanted to do.
lags all the time. hardly connects ever. I would think for an internet tv.. maybe they would cover their bases and include an ethernet port. I hate this tv.
Easy set up . Spectrum cable is so expensive  I  can now use my firestick with my smart TV and no more expensive cable bill . Hello Smart TV. GOOD BYE SPECTRUM CABLE...
"love this TV, definition is great and can login to any provider to watch movies and shows, can listen to music, watch music videos, has a screen savers and backgrounds, it's just a great item"
"Love, Love, Love my TV. Its refurbished and works great. Love all the apps that come with it plus the ability to download so many more!
Every since I bout my first TCL that's all I've bought since."
Great value.  My only complaint is the remote is so small.   Easy to lose.   Can not click on chamnels need to go up and down.    If had another remote would be great
"This is my second TCL TV. I could not be happier with the picture, the performance and the overall set.   I would recommend to anyone looking for a good tv at a very fair price."
well I had it working only for one week and the picture went out! so I was able to return it and bought a Samsung TV. so I don't think it was worth the time for a TLC smart roku tv.
"For the price of this Tv ;the picture clarity, ease of use of the smart device feature, number of hdmi ports are great. The remote is easy to use with built in streaming features that are easy to get to."
Best priced Smart TV. GREAT value for the cost. If you want to get off the cable grid...FREE tv channels can't be beat. Just need the internet! Good picture and sound...only need one remote for all functions of the tv.
"Great buy!  Purchased the 43"" for our Sun room, will probably purchased another one for the living room.  Great picture.  No need for cable or Satellite TV."
This TV was recommended by a friend. It is an expensive but I wish now that I had bought a more expensive TV with a larger screen. This TV looks like it's being swallowed up by the room. The sound could be better but you get what you pay for.
"This TV is as described, delibered on time, and has truly easy set up. I was skeptical at first, but it is a great brand. The picture quality is amazing, and there have been no issues thusfar."
Picture isnt clear the kids dont even like to play video game on it.  Reviews are misleading. I dont get it.  Bought for christmas but didnt keep box otherwise i would have returned it and got something else.
"Lasted a little over a year then the top 1/3 of the screen darkened by approximately 30%.. just after the warranty runs out! TCL was no help,oh well get what you pay for, but come on..only a year!!"
"had it for a  year lately been acting up , now it's been shutting off by itself when u are watching TV , tried looking under the options to see if it's been tampered with but nope. can't fix it ."
"IT works great. I am a single woman with kids, so a large tv was not my priority. It is large enough for all of us to comfortably watch our shows or listen to music on youtube."
"Why am I required to give this a star? I have owned and used this TV for a little over two weeks. It just quit working. Thats it. No sign of it about to fail, it just never came back on the last time I turned it off. Piece off junk"
Great TV!!! Just because it's not as expensive as other brands means nothing because I've had mine for 4 years and it's still working as well as the day I bought it.
"Just bought this today. Took it home, unpacked it, put the stand on, turned on the tv, and IT IS BROKEN, NOT WORKING, ALL I GET IS GARBAGE ON THE SCREEN AND A LIGHT AT THR CENTER BOTTOM. I'm not happy."
Had some not so good experiences in the past with smart TVs so I was skeptical but after carefully​ looking at the specs on this TV decided to give it a try. This was so much more user friendly than other models. I highly recommend.
Can you watch regular TV programs with this TV.  The Box shows 2. Remotes but I only got one.  I love the TV but need to know if cable can be connected to it or if I am missing a remote.
This tv is garbage..roku is crap freezes all the time..cant get the casting to work the majority of the time...wasted my money...defiantly wont buy this brand again..
this is so confusing. Smart TV is of no use for 65 year old who just wants a simple tv. I cannot even change channels without going through each one.  150 page manual of gobblygook
I bought this TV from the walmart in monaca and was given a broken TV and was denied a refund/return! So i had to come back to the Baden walmart and purchase a new TV
I did not like that it came in it's original box. Someone could've stolen my purchase while in transit. I would suggest that next time anyone orders a tv from your site that it's in a plain box with no description listed.
Worst experience ever and I even bought the $8 dollars protection plan for the TV which at the end it didnât help I will suggest big time to NOT   Get it  NOT BUY IT Youâre just going to throw your money awayï¿¼
These TVs are horrible and cheaply made I bought two of these at the same time and they both went out a week after each other with color lines all throughout the tv the TVs are less than a year old
Like the tv. But the remote is a cheap unit it doesn't operate like a remote from a Roku unit. You can tell by the weight alone. The tv works very well.
"Great TV!  I took advantage of the sale and tried this brand.  The picture is very good, color is great and sound is awesome.  Easy to install.  Fits nicely on my bedroom dresser.  I highly recommend this item."
"The tv comes with a 1-year warranty and the funny part is exactly after 1 year, it started to malfunction!!! The TV operates by itself and it is impossible to control it using a remote or builtin button."
"My personal experiece has been ver positive, great tv for the price, i bought one for my bedroom, one for my 2 grandaughters and one for my daughter very happy so far... no issues at all"
I have had this T.V. for about 3 yrs now and it is working as good as when we first bought it!! Very good brand!! Planning on buying a larger one soon.
Absolutely love this tv! Very inexpensive and the feet for the stand are well built! Just enough clearance under the tv to slide a blu ray or DVD player under.
"this is the perfect tv. It is so cheap and it has everything i need such as youtube, hulu, netflix, and xfinity. Its a great size too. Just what i wanted and shipping was fast"
Had this tv for 3 weeks and all of a sudden it started making this loud grindinf noise. I had to give it one star to just post this but it would be a big fat zero if I could! Donât waste your money!!
"Set up was easy and nice picture with decent sound after adjusting in settings.  Free channels are mediocre at best.  Does not work well with certain apps such as NBCsports.  NetFlix, which we pay for, was the only thing that worked fairly decent.  After 6 months, cannot connect to internet even though it scans/sees our WiFi network.  Says go to tclusa.com for help.  Piece of junk."
"This was a birthday gift from my family and it has exceeded my expectations. The tv is extremely user friendly and the setup was a breeze. I'm enjoying the picture quality, the channel selection and I get to listen to Pandora right from the tv! This is a great investment and eliminates the need of the big old bulky cable box."
"Had Tv for about 3 yrs. First issue started a few months ago, when trying play a video on YouTube the screen would get really dim. Adjusting the brightness would not fix issue. After awhile, just simply powering the TV on, the screen would be very dim and I found out the reset button temporarily fixed the issue. Now my current problem is my screen will not stop blinking. Reset button does not help anymore, I think it made the issue worse! Buy at your own risk! This is not one of those ""long term"" reliable electronics!"
"I had to buy a 32"" tv because it is the biggest size that will fit my entertainment center. I just love this television EXCEPT it rearranges my antenna stations every time I erase them all and do a new channel search. Why can't they just let them in numerical order instead of mixing them around the way they want them? WHO OWNS THE TELEVISION? I have searched on the internet for a solution but failed. I want to send TCL a support email but their website has refused to allow me to do that on every attempt. Do I have to return it?"
"Bought this tv about 2 weeks ago .  Worked good for a few days .  Then after about 2 hours of using it, it wood shut off .  I did a factory reset on it . Was ok for about a week . Now its doing it again and the remote wont respond . I have had enough of this tv . I have bought Roku products for years and never had trouble . Im taking this tv back and getting my money back ."
"I have ad this tv for 13 months. About 6 months in, I would turn on tv and have no sound. it happened about once every couple of weeks. It has progressed to about 3 times a week now. I have tried troubleshooting, updating, and talking to the company (they don't respond). I have to unplug it each and every time it does it to get sound back. I fear that in the next month it will be a daily occurrence. Other than that, it has a great picture and when the sound works, it sounds great."
"I have one already and I'm buying another one for my bedroom and I'm thinking to get one for my kitchen.
I live in a 120 unit building and I have manage to tell all my friends about how great the TV is, and already, few of my neighbors had purchase a few of them.
Great Job TCL,  Great Product....."
"Unfortunately, a little over a year of buying this TV, the picture just went black! The audio still worked and when you tried the remote, you can hear the clicking noise, but the picture is pitch black and I'm not sure the cause or reason. I had a another year for the warranty but sadly this was all during COVID-19 and Walmart wasn't accepting returns at the time. So put it back in it's box that it came in and it sat in my closet for a couple months (out of sight out of mind for me) until the protection plan expired. I'm not sure what to do with this TV now. I'd hate to throw it out if it's possibly an easy fix or something. Other than that, never had any problems with the TV."
Do not buy this piece of junk. It worled for less than a month then constantly loses internet signal. Can't stream a show for more than 30 seconds. Customer service makes you go through a lot of stuff to prove his and then just blames the internet company. What a waste of a tv.
"Have had this about a year, if you are just looking for a TV don't waste your time, to start when setting up this tv to cable it is nearly impossible to figure out, and whatever you do don't call roku customer service all they will tell you is that you have to subscribe to roku or it wont work. After finally getting the TV to play and using two remotes one for cable and one for TV the sound has gone, after reading up I have found this is typical of roku tv's there are some fixes on you tube but will not work on the one I have. This was a waste of money and time from the start. Do not buy."
"I bought this TV three days ago and what a mistake. First of all, I mounted to my wall and thought everything was fine, then I noticed a piece of paper on the floor. When I went to pick up the paper ,which was under the TV, the TV fell on my head. I was lying on the floor in  pool of my own blood and urine. Now it doesn't work right. I wish I had read the instructions better. I will be returning this TV, as soon as I clean all the blood and urine off of it."
"I bought this TV about a year/year and a half ago to replace the one that was in the bedroom. At first I thought that it was a pretty good quality TV, especially for being rather inexpensive. Well about 4 - 5 months ago the volume all of a sudden decided not to work one day. After 30 minutes of troubleshooting the issue, I gave up and turned it off. After a few hours, I turned it back on to see if the volume was working again... and to my surprise, the volume was working once again.  
Up to 3 weeks ago, there hasn't been any additional issues, and the volume continued to work as normal. Well, currently the volume is back to not working whatsoever. My husband has attempted to fix it as well, but unfortunately he hasn't been able to successfu..."
I wanted a tv in my kitchen without running a cable to it. and with this tv all I did was hang it on the wall plug in the power cord and it picked up my wifi and it lets me watch my live or recorded things from my cable dvr ( with app ) and has so many extras why in my kitchen ? Because when I am cooking I don't like to leave the room fires are to easy to happen when left unattended . I have also added my Netflix and you tube on it very good TV.
"I have had mine for a over a year now, and this TV is worth the price. It works very well for what it does.

I have experienced lag when using apps like YouTube, Netflix, and even the Roku Channel. The response to the stop/back/play commands (etc) usually take a moment to complete if I have been watching a video for any length of time. For instance, when I actively browse YouTube, everything works well and I can quickly pause, go back, scroll, etc.  However, if I watch a video that is more than 10 minutes long or so, the command to ""pause"" will take about 3 seconds to complete.  And after that the lag continues for a few moments more before things begin to respond quickly again.

The left side of the screen has a shadow about 2"" wide that g..."
"Me and my husband bought one May 2020, and 3 days ago all of the sudden while we was watching it the screen went black but we still had audio. We tried many different things to see if it would fix it but nothing worked, we even done the factory reset. My husband purchased the 2 year extended warranty but we can not find the receipt.....so we have no tv and during this time we can not afford to purchase another one! But when we do it won't be this brand!"
"This tv is lightweight and was so easy to set up! I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my teenager who will be heading off to college soon. She had it out of the box, logged in, and ready to watch in under 15 minutes. One of the best features was being able to easily link to our living room tv that uses a Roku box. 

My daughter loves that this Roku tv was easily customizable, and she has enjoyed setting it up. 

I am now seriously considering purchasing another of these to replace our current tv in the living room.

We definitely feel like we got more tv than we were expecting for $150."
I bought this online without seeing the oucture quslity fitst.  wjen i received it oit eas very easy to set up and search for channels. Nice sized remote but the quality of the picture was terrible.  If I had another TV in the house I would have returned this one and just lost the money that I had paid for the extended warranty.  I would definitely suggest that before purchasing this TV you check it out in person if at all possible. When I bought it at about $149 it was an online promotuon only and after trying it and seeing how lousy the picture quality is I could understand why it was sold that way. Despite the price I would definitely not recomend this TV to anyone.
"Worked ok for the first few months.  Then it would randomly restart for no reason.  Constantly buffering (NOT an internet issue, it's a TV issue!),  at least 4-5 times a day it says ""no internet"" when I know the internet is fine (I have high speed cable internet).  The latest issue is that it will zoom (all by itself) to some part of the screen and stretch that corner of the screen so that's all you can see.  It's less than a year old, and it's basically worthless, because all the issues make it nearly impossible to get thru one TV show without some issue."
This is the worst TV I have ever had it never stays connected so there is virtually no reason to say it's a smart TV and when I wanted to use the website and they to get some help it was just as frustrating they want the ezacrbdaye you purchased and the model and ss number of the TV just save yourself the stress and buy something else.
about this TV for my son at a Walmart for Christmas I said man what a deal on a TV too good to be true yep took TV out of the box it's broken screens busted Walmart will not take it back try and manufacture now hasn't got back to me. Merry Christmas son. mad customer
"READ BEFORE BUYING: (regretful purchase) bought this tv about 1 year ago I hadn’t used it since last year and now it’s not working? So now I can’t use it at all. Also have another tv this brand that’s a bigger size and right when I bought it, it started saying it was overheating. Still does it too. Lots of problems with this tv, just invest in a better brand."
"VERY disappointed in this purchase have had it for two days and have spent more time RECONNECTING to wifi REENTERING login information.
If you do not DIRECTALY aim  the remote at the TV it will not work.
AVOID buying this tv not worth the extra money.
BAD MISTAKE BUYING THIS TV"
"I purchased the 32S301 for my daughter a year ago for Christmas.   I kept having to call to have the signal reset even though the WiFi was plugged into the same outlet.   1 week out of warranty the TV died.  No picture,  no sound.   Won't turn on at all. 
TCL nor Walmart will assist.   She's disabled and barely used the TV.  Less than 200 hours on the item and now it's trash.  This one is probably no better.   I would think twice before purchasing."
I bought this tv opened it up and it had multiple long cracks diagonally across the screen.....also it did not work at all...the only function that worked was the on and off button....it is unbelievable that any business would sell something so damaged and dysfunctional that it belonged in the scrap yard.
This television was a gift that I picked out for myself for the main bedroom in the home. I love that the Roku is built into the tv and that I don't need an extra piece of equipment causing clutter in the room. It was easy to set-up and I use it everyday from listening to music with the Spotify app to binge watching Friends again! I love it.
"I bought this TV in store, just wanted a small TV for my room, and it’s rare to watch a show without the tv returning logging out of Netflix and returning the the Home Screen. Even when I Cast a show from my phone, the show buffers or lags constantly. I wish I could return it but I already threw the box out."
"I purchased this tv to put it in a room where I didn't have a cable connection. I initially had an issue maintaining a wifi connection. I resolved the issue by updating the wifi from 802.11n to 802.11ac (a.k.a. wifi 5). It seems to be working just fine now. 

I added Amazon Prime and Xfinity Stream Beta apps. It takes a little while to get used to the simplified remote to change channles on Xfinity Stream Beta, but I feel it is an acceptable alternative. The Option (*) button is very useful with Xfinity Stream Beta."
"I had upgraded my cable box, and thought it a perfect time to upgrade the TV in our spare bedroom. I was so impressed at the quality of the picture, and the features available on this TV, I moved it into the master bedroom! Great value for the price!"
"I was surprised at how easy it is to use this TV, as well as to add other features such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. Love the picture quality and all the freebies that come with this TV. The low cost is exceptional for the product. I don't have any complaints at all."
"I purchased this tv, not even 3hrs ago, came home opened the box, the tv was cracked at the top, and the tv has food stains on the screen. It doesnât look brand new. The remote has family dollar brand of batteries in it. and to top it off IT DOES NOT POWER ON. Im highly irritated about this."
This tv was bought to go in the kids room so that they could watch Netflix. They are ages 5&6 and have absolutely no problem navigating the tv. The controller is small and there is minimal buttons so it makes it that much easier for them. 10/10 in my book for what it's being used for.
"Can't believe how easy it was to set up TV. I am a female in my upper seventies and was able to carry it upstairs, attach legs, plug in and follow prompts on screen. Hooked it right up to my streaming subscription. So pleased I could start watching in about 15 minutes!"
Well I took a chance on this brand and even researched the company having never bought a product of theirs. At first it was amazing and I was pleased. Three weeks later the wi fi couldn't find a signal and would hang until I unplugged the unit and it resolved the issue.  This continues to happen now 45 days into my Christmas purchase. Today three golf ball sized round circles have appeared in the lower  left corner  and hours later a long thin white line.  Also until the internet is connected the time is never correct though running digital TV.
"We bought this TV approximately 8 months ago. A month ago four large black circles showed up on the bottom and right side of the screen. Yesterday the picture went black with a white line down the middle. Today no picture, sound, nothing. What a waste of money!"
A lego was thrown at the tv and the screen cracked. And although I bought the extra warranty it wouldn?t be replaced. The tv was a great purchase worked amazing. Just wish their warranty or the additional warranty would have covered the item like stated.
"I would have rated the TCL Roku 32"" Smart TV  (Model 32S321 ) a Five-Star  *****.  Its price was much below Japanese/Korean Competitors and the picture quality seemed similar...  Setup was easy-- Just connect the set to my home's WiFi Network and the downloadable setup manager takes care of everything.. it pauses when the user needs to select preferred channel selections, etc. (be prepared to register a BankCard --Roku and other Streaming media providers provide some free content but no company can continue without ongoing revenue-- eventually they hope you will  elect to purchase programming so they keep your bankcard saved to facilitate an impulse purchase. ).... We were elated  Day 1--- but that feeling ended soon..   Our TCL TV is prone..."
"Enjoying this TV. Perfect size for my bedroom. Easy set-up. Good reception on Free antenna TV, great streaming experience. Not missing cable and saving lots of money. Remote takes getting used to not being able to punch in channel numbers, but minor inconvenience. Sound adequate for bedroom."
"Not a bad TV at all!  Great picture quality!  Easy to use and a clear display.  Remote is simple and light weight. Will buy a larger screen size the next time.  For the value,  I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great deal. I am very much satisfied."
"All of these TVs are slow and lag, remotes suck and don’t last and the app doesn’t always connect, it’ll say “echo mode” but there’s no fix so it basically only works when it wants to, 10/10 would not recommend, yes it’s cheap but definitely not good quality"
"When I received my TCL 32 Class HD (720P) Roku Smart TV (32S321) there was a crack in the screen. No problem, we return the TV to Walt-mart; where we purchased and immediately got an exchange. We returned home, plugged it up, beautiful picture, easy set up, easy remote control use, easy change from program to program. Nice light sleek design and so worth the money. I definitely recommend this TV as a smart buy."
"I use this tv for when im just watching youtube or some other streaming service. The menu navigation is pristine and extremely simple to use. I wouldnt reccomend it for anything extreme like gaming since its refresh rate is not really designed for the more intense designed games but its not too bad if this would be your only option. All in all, i reccomend it if your looking for something simple for the bedroom."
"I'm not sure how long I've had it, but it was purchased when I was living here, and I've only been here for about 4 years, so I know that it hasn't been very long, and the picture gave out in it yesterday.

I have sound but no picture so the TV, in my opinion, didn't last very long."
we purchased this tv while browsing in store. we had walked past these tvs over the past few months wondering if it was worth it to upgrade to something simple and newer. let me say for the price this tv stands out. we are very happy with the tv. the picture is surprisingly crisp volume is good for the size and the tv is very light. the colors are good and it's very easy to navigate. pretty much plug and play. definitely recommend
"I've long been a fan of Roku devices. I have two in use at home right now. I was excited to find a TV with one built in at a price just over the cost of a Roku device. Set-up was easy and I was watching a program in minutes. With use of my cable company's app, I can watch anything on this TV without renting another cable box. Since this setup requires no wiring, I can move the TV out to the patio if I want. (As with any Roku device, you'll need a strong wi-fi signal. I have internet through my cable company, and it's a stronger signal than when I previously had it through a phone company.)

Overall, this TV is a great buy, and if I had more rooms, I'd buy more TVs. The picture is 720 dpi, which is a lower display strength than 1040 dpi or 4..."
Tv is ok and it works with our Amazon Alexa device too. However the remote with this tv is awful. The response time is quite slow. Sometimes you push a button multiple times and nothing. Yeah I've changed batteries numerous times. I've used a lot of remotes over the years but this is a good tv lousy remote
Own 2 tcl tvs one just recently went out after a year. Bought a second one for my room before the other went out and had to take it back to store because the picture kept going out. The one i got to replace it keeps freezing and resetting itself constantly. Ok for kids tv but not for much of anything else. Would recommend buying a better brand
Super easy to set up and navigate through- clear picture - great sound! Super impressed for the price - this is a great value! As I told the manufacturer the hardest thing with this TV was figuring out how to get my sound bar to talk to the TV - no clear instructions- however I was able to find help on Youtube so it works now! I highly recommend this TV- great value!
"I purchased this TCL Roku TV because it had all the features I needed and not at such a high price. What a mistake. I purchased it in January and have tried to get a hold of the company by email and phone to no avail. This TV buffers constantly and shuts off whenever it feels like shutting off. I know other reviews say its such a wonderful piece of equipment But its not. I wanted to exchange it but could get no help with that either from TCL or Walmart. I asked somebody if they wanted it before I take it to electronica recycling. If they take it, I hope they have better results than I did. 
 Oh by the way, I had somebody come over and try to fix it and it couldnt be fixed. If youre looking for a TV, Save yourself some money and dont buy it...."
TV for a good price took it home Connected it to my Wi-Fi then I was prompted to go online on my computer or cell phone to enter a four digit code the code was not allowing me to except it on my television or phone so I gave me a phone number to call when calling I was advised in order to use any of the apps on the Roku television I had to pay $90 To create a Roku account in order to use my television??? Donât know why I was not told about this before purchasing plan on returning
"This TV requires a credit card before it will work. You must setup an account with Roku before the TV will turn of so you can watch it. The TV offers alot of programming and thus they ask for a credit card. But it would be nice if you opt out of this process. Unfortunately, you can not get the TV out of the setup process without providing credit card when setting up an account."
"Perfect!  just wanted a small cheap TV for my apartment, and its SO easy to use and the screen is sharp I just LOVE it. Great screen, GREAT built in antenna-- EVERYTHING you'd want with wifi and games.  

I cant believe this was budget shopping! I even upgraded and only ended up returning every other model I tried because of its antenna and easy wifi menus 

(Has PBS kids, works great with my Samsung, better local reception than my black box, and got me into all kinds of fun stuff I haven't seen in decades off Youtube and Disney. the grandparents like it better than their Sony.) 

I love this TV!!! 

oh and so LIGHT!!"
"Absolutely loved this tv for my kids since it was perfect size and budget friendly. I bought two of them Feb 2019 for just over $100 a piece  Great picture and sound. But less than a month ago my daughters TV randomly went black. You could still hear it but couldnt see anything. Then last week my sons TV did the same exact thing. I tried every troubleshoot that we could do to no avail. I wouldnt recommend this TV at all. Obviously if the same issue happened to both TVs within weeks of each other, there is probably a defect somewhere."
"I love this TV in every way except the remote control. The remote must be facing the television straight ahead and aimed up high. I have been spoiled by the remote control for my old Roku Express where I hardly had to be in the room to make it work! And who knows - my remote might just need newer batteries because I am using the batteries that came with my TV last month. 

I recommend this Roku TV from TCL and Walmart for offering it at a great price."
"I have 3 other tcl TVs. A 55, 43 and a 40. I got this one for one of the kids rooms. The TV powered on and I had to go through the steps as normal when dealing with a tcl roku TV. However, I got stuck on this one. I was able to connect to internet but it required an update to go through with the roku activation. It would not let me update via wireless and the this model isn't even on the tcl website for me to load the update on a USB device. There is no lan connection for me to direct connect with this to the internet either. The roku code on this TV is 8112X which doesn't appear to even exist on the roku website under tcl TVs to update it. Its going back unfortunately. I have not had issues like this with my other tcl TVs or my Samsung. I ..."
Purchased this tv for my mother for her birthday present. The picture quality is excellent and she loves the fact of the smart apps right on the tv so no need for additional equipment . The price was excellent compared to other tv and picture quality just the same as pricer brands
"Anything I would want to watch, plus all new things I didn't know existed, all in one place at the touch of a button! I have my movies, tv shows, nifty aerial views of earth, customizable screensavers, music, PLUS a fantastic screen for all of my gaming needs! Definitely worth every penny!!!"
"first thing is there is a delay from the controller to the TV it registers you clicked but don't click 
just today I get home turn it on and speakers don't work  
I've only had this TV for like 5 months and with I would have returned it right when I opened it"
"I really like this TV, it's easy to use and set up, and is so easy to use my 1 year old nephew is able to use Roku with no problem. Very light weight, nice look, and it's nice that Roku will take you step by step if any complications pop up and becomes irritable, but those have been few and far between. I absolutely would recommend this Roku tv as excellent purchase and with it's affordable price you can't lose."
It's good...shows a beautiful picture...u just gotta download good apps to watch if u don't have cable this tv would be good for you but u have to have WIFI and you're set to go...the only thing I dont like is that the CBS app isn't free...i mean it's downloaded on my phone from the PLAYSTORE for FREE but roku is asking me to pay hopefully they will make changes HOPEFULLY
"It is an easy set up, lightweight smart tv with plenty of ports for your favorite component. However, I don't care for the Roku set up and the sound is almost non-existent.  The remote is a little too basic and the sound buttons are on the side. We kept muting it every time the remote was picked up.  I'm sure some would like it, but I'll stick with my 8 year old Samsung and streaming blue-ray player."
"I love the TV its great. Great picture and great price. 
The only issue ive seen is with the sound. 
The sound will cut in and out sometimes for an unknown reason. A friend of ours just had to replace her because her sound would cut in and out and finallly stop all together"
"I love this TV and have never regreted purchasing it. We've had this TV in our bedroom for 4 months now. The picture is great, the sound is loud and crisp. I love watching YouTube and Netflix in bed. I have a cable box hooked up to HDMI 1 and my laptop hooked up to HDMI 2. I can play computer games with my wireless mouse and keyboard! It's so cool! We also have Disney + and a bunch of other apps, like USA, TLC, History Channel, Food Network, ect which are available through our cable subscription. The screen isn't huge, but it's large enough for our little bedroom. I kind of wish the remote lit up in the dark, but all in all I'm in love with my TCL Roku TV!"
Bought Nov 2018 writing this review Feb 2020 - the tv worked well all along until this week where it will no longer connect to the internet. and after being on the phone with TCL tech support to try to troubleshoot. They said that the networking board is bad and out of warranty. Bought for kids room- thought I would get 3-5 years out of it but no such luck.
This TV has a great picture and is very easy to set up from the start. It lets you pick channels from the start when setting up the beginning and also after the set up to make it even more easily accessible to the channels you might want to watch. My husband is ready to go buy a bigger one for our living room now. If you're looking for a TV this is the one I would recommend.
"The price was right and it's not bad at all. It has a nice, clear picture. It's a smart tv. It was super easy to set up. It was bought for my 2 year old and I love that they are very lightweight tvs so I never have to worry about it falling and hurting someone."
My wife and I were looking for a small TV to put in or gym. We found that the TCL 32in was the best value. We were surprised about all the features and apps available for this device and it works well. The picture quality is on par are somewhat above average TV brands. If you have a budget and you need good quality TV TCL is the way to go.
I'm returning the 2nd TCL Roku in less than 1 year. Both of them had the sound go out on HDMI channels. That's just nuts. Bought our first in June 2018. Had to return and exchange it Sept 2018 (4 months). Now the HDMI is out on this one. Returning again - March 2019  (6 months) - - this time I'll get something else.
"This is the best tv I've ever owned, and this is coming from a teenage tech nerd and computer science major. For 720 resolution, the picture is phenomenal and is not noticeably different from my $800 LG 4k Ultra HD TV. I honestly like this TV much more than the LG. This Roku TV has the ability to make cable obsolete! I get thousands of shows and movies for 100% free. Can't beat the value and quality. Only complaint is the speakers aren't the best but they definitely aren't bad. This is the only TV I ever want."
"Odd Flawlessly plays roku but has the hardest time reading button clicks on all other streaming apps (have to click it 30 times for it to read, bought new remote and new batteries, still the same.) Will never buy TCL again!!! What a let down, waste of money."
Purchased this T.V. in October of 2018. The unit turns on but there is no picture only a crackling sound with the led light lit. The TV was taken out of the box and hung immediately on the wall. It has had no damage physically. Very dissatisfied!! Tried calling support only to be on hold for over an hour and then hung up on.
"I bought. this tv 4 months ago to replace the off brand tv that I bought 6 months earlier from the same co. I do have insurance this time but shirley a tv shoutvwork for 6 months.  to be fair, I have as Vizio tv, also purchased from wallmart that has never had any trouble."
"I have purchased 2 of these and one in a larger size. I will continue purchasing these in the future  because they’re perfect for our family. Roku has the best streaming platform, hands down. I love the clutter free aspect of this tv since we don’t need to have a separate streaming device on the shelf. Sound and picture are perfect for the price. These are very lightweight and have minimal surface area taken. The software is super quick and easy to navigate."
"I was skeptical about this brand of tv. I knew nothing about them. I went ahead and plunge and got one. For $118.00 it was worth a gamble. I must say the gamble payed off big time. I am super happy with my purchase. The price is good and the roku interface is incredible. I also love the remote. I have owned my TCL for just over a month and never had any issues. It doesn't drop connection, turn off lock up or have picture issues like some other brands I have seen. I will be buying the bigger model for the living room soon. You guys earned a new customer!!"
We bought this tv for our grandsons 5 years ago works as well today as it did then. It has been used constantly for veiwing videos on you tube and has had three different game consoles connected over the years. Great little tv we liked it so much we now own two of them.
This T. V is great. Simple to use. Good for any age group for either elderly or up to toddlers ages. My 3 old can work her T. V with no problems so that says alot. The quality of it is good. Clear pictures. And it's durable. My 1 one year old has smacked there T. V hard several times and it has not broke yet or even left a scratch on it. Now that says lot about the quality of the T. V it's not made cheap. The price I got for it was amazing. I wish bought more. And next time I go to purchase another T. V it will be another Roku. Period! Also if you want to save money buy it! All you need is internet and it has free Roku channel which has tons of shows in movies on it. Cable is expensive. Believe me I know. So if you want good quality and sav...
"We bought this TV for our kids since we donât have cable and it was SUCH a good investment! There are hundreds of apps you can download. The ones we use most are Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, PBS Kids, Youtube, CBS all access and directv now. Similar to Directv but its only live streaming. The kids can watch their favorite shows, listen to music, etc. video quality is amazing! And if you lose the remote, theres a romu remote app for android and iphone (might be wrong about android but i know there is onr for iphone, i have it lol). We have an older tv in the living room and we plan on replacing it next month with another Roku TV. It makes streaming SOOOO convenient!! The only downside (and it has nothing to do with the tv, but the app comp..."
I chose to get a smart TV and avoid cable. I like the interface and that everything is readily available to choose including streaming apps. I like the price point as well. Only drawback is the remote. It's easy to use but I would like numbers on channels so I can easily go from channel to next otherwise great buy!!!
"This tv is butté cheeks. It is very laggy when browsing, the audio is often delayed, and the remote needs to be pointed perfectly at the receiver or else it doesnt register at all, and the audio quality is poor. You get what you pay for, I suppose, which is a cheap smart tv."
"We bought 2 of these about a year and a half ago. Today we turned one on to find it had no sound. We've turned it off and back on and tried everything. Sucks. We never buy tv warranties, but i expected to get longer than this out it. Otherwise it worked fine until this."
We've had it for a year now and are quite happy with it.  We have a Firestick on our older flat screen and have a Samsung Smart TV.  Other than sizes there isn't much difference. Hooked it up to an antenna for the free tv and use the prime app and use other apps if we're interested.  We've cut the cable and this little tv fits us fine.
"We bought the TV in March, so it's too late to return.

We had it in a safe location, and it went untouched and in the box until a few weeks ago. We took it out and started using it and it worked great...until now. The screen suddenly went black while we had a show paused to get a snack (in its little sleep mode, I assume?) and won't come back. We've tried everything. Less than three weeks of very light use and it's toast.

We had another one that worked great before this but I guess we got lucky with that one because this one was a total waste."
"At first it worked ok, but after initial setup now it's stuck on the startup menu and whatever you press on the remote only shows volume on or off. I'm very tech savvy, and can't do anything with it. It's been over a year, don't think Walmart will allow me to return the tv. I would not waste your hard earned money."
"first, my sister got this for her daughter's room and I thought it was quite small but you couldn't get any better for the price so I tried it and boy was I wrong I got it for my thirteen-year-old daughter its a great tv for the price and I really would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable tv."
"This TV is awesome. It has a great picture, great sound, easy use remote. Can access tons of programs and channels and TV apps like Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, CBS All Access, and tons of free channels. It is an awesome TV for an EXCELLENT AFFORDABLE PRICE. I highly recommend this TV."
Got this 32 inch smart tv at a great price has all you need an the the sound quality is great an the picture quality is excellent highly recommend this item !!! I got in on the referral of my nephew who bought one a year ago for his 12 year old daughter!!! Glad I got it!!!
"Setup was a bit lengthy, definitely setup Roku ahead of time. Channel searching was also pretty slow but not terrible. After setup it's an amazing tv. Every option I wanted and a fantastic price. I especially like the one remote idea, but the remote app is awesome too."
"I have purchased 6 of these Tv's over the past few years... they break way too easily, and the warranty is such a hassle.  The picture is very pretty, adding apps is seamless, and I love Roku products... but I currently have 2 of these sitting in my living room broken and useless."
"We sold our home and moved our family into a travel trailer. The old 50"" plasma had to go and we bought two of these TCL units with the built-in Roku. One for the living area and one for the kids' room. These have been one of the best electronics purchases I've made in my life. The ""smart"" component provided by the Roku is very quick and intuitive. I liked how the home screen can be customized and the inputs renamed (along with changing the icon). The kids love it and can use it easily due to the simple remote and aforementioned interface. Picture quality is great. They have worked great with multiple gaming systems and DVD/Blu Ray players. Plenty of inputs for everything we need.

We sold the trailer and moved back into a home and the TCL'..."
"I would have given this 0 Stars if you were able to, we bought a service warranty and our TV broke exactly one year and one month from purchase one month after the warranty was no good even through the manufacturer of the TV they wouldn't even send a repairman out do not waste your money"
"Do not buy this television!!! It will shut down after a few minutes. We googled how to fix it, and Google predicts that you are going to type ""TCL television shuts down"".  If you happen to be playing a video game, tough luck--game over.  You will need to start all over after turning the tv back on. It might stay on for another 10 minutes if you are lucky, and then it shuts down again. 

Junk. Junk. Junk. waste of money and after 30 days Wal-Mart refuses to refund it. I had the pleasure of the customer service supervisor named Becky in the Maryville, MO Wal-Mart calling me honey while explaining why they could do nothing. Frankly, I'm not her honey, nor do I care to be patronized by someone defending the policy of not standing behind the jun..."
"best overall value of flat screens I've purchased in the past. from a 65in Mitsubishi to a couple of 40 inch Samsungs. excellent picture quality, easy setup versatility. I purchase two of these sets a little over a year ago, with no problems. highly recommend!"
"I would recommend the New Roku Smart LED TV to anyone looking for a New TV! It's easy to set up, has a very clear picture, good sound. There are so many Channels you can watch for free! If you're tired of paying for TV this is a must have! I Love My Roku TV!"
"If I could rate this Tv no stars I would. We brought this tv Feb 28
the tv accidentally fell on my carpet and the whole screen smashed. They will not replace this tv. The tv legs are made very unstable and the screen is very fragile. Walmart would not give you any kind of refund."
"When I first bought this TV it seemed like a decent value for the price.  Picture quality not so good but ok for $159 I guess.  Then after about two months all of the controls started freezing up.  Can't change channels, can't go back and forth between input modes, can't even turn it off -- have to unplug it.  No warranty support to speak of.  Probably have no choice but to trhow it out"
"I received this tv as a Christmas gift. Initially, I was pretty excited to use the tv as it has the Roku streaming feature. After setting it up and using for approximately 2 months, I find it frustrating to use as the tv performs inconsistently and has a mind of its own. The remote control freezes constantly and when it does work, I have to be parked 8’ from the tv infra red sensor on the front/bottom of the tv panel. Even when I stand directly in front of the tv and point the remote forward, it still works inconsistently. I checked the remote batteries that came with the tv and they are fine so it is either the remote or the sensor on the tv.  Also occasionally, when streaming a movie, the movie freezes. The live tv is a nice feature but i..."
"Great little TV. Set up in 10 minutes, connects to internet better than my TV's with the added ROKU unit. With ROKU built in this is as simple as it gets. Picture quality is great. This unit is for a spare bedroom and will not be heavily used. At 124 bucks it cannot be beat."
"Worst TV I've ever owned. Sling freezes and then just shuts my whole TV down. Hulu takes 5 minutes to load, Netflix never gets past the Netflix page. So I called TCL customer support, told them what was going on, they made me do 100 different things, nothing worked, and internet is more than up to speed. I've had these problems since I bought the TV and TCL just told me that there's nothing more they could do, and to go buy a new TV! Terrible Company."
"Was on sale, however; extended warranty was removed.  It gets 1 star because I assume the warranty provider says it's only worth one. 
.

TCL 32"" Class 720P HD LED Roku Smart TV 3 Series 32S331
$99.00/ea
Add-on service not available

I missed the sale and got lucky,  didn't waste money on something that doesn't qualify for extended warranty."
"Bought this tv for mother's bedroom. Basic cable hookup with coaxial to tv, no converter. Setup was easy but the sound on many cable channels were distorted with loud static, none of roku channels though.  Thought it might be in cable so I had cable company come to check. The guy checked different things inside and out then said he has seen this problem on several tcl tvs and that the coaxial on tv causing problem so I returned tv for exchange of same model. Same exact problem as 1st. I moved tv to different room, same problem. Brought it home and hooked up to my cable, same problem-static on many cable channels. I tried adjusting different sound settings with no luck. I will be returning the 2nd tv as well and choosing a different brand. T..."
"I purchased this three months ago but sadly did not pay extra for warranty. This tv responds very slowly to the remote. Reminds me of the old tube televisions of the 60s that had to warm up before they come on. The TLC isn't that slow but there is a lag time when turning on, off, changing channels or volume. I should have returned it then but decided the inconvenience greater to try to return. (I am an elderly And homebound).
Now the sound is has developed an echo and I have shut off and turned back on several times. Sound may work properly for a few minutes, but echo returns in a few minutes? I am past my 30 day return date and Amon my own with this disastrous purchase. I would advise you not make the mistakes I made."
"It has a mind of its own. Sometimes I turn it on and it has my local channels and sometimes it has about 100 channels I have no interest in. Sometimes it will not hold onto YouTube TV and just goes back to the selection process and other times it works. Basically a DUMB TV and not very smart at all. Also, control does not have number selection. You must go through the entire list instead of just picking a channel you want. If you want to revert to the previous channel --- back through the list again. When it gets tired, it just turns off in the middle of a show. No picture included here as it would just be me pulling my hair out in frustration. Bought it during the height of early Covid and it was the only model in Walmart at the time. A pi..."
"This TV is very light weight, but it arrived with bad ir sensor.... you have to press the buttons on the remote multiple time to get an action. I tried other remotes from my other Roku TCL TVs and same issue. I looked with a light and the plastic on the receiver is all cloudy."
"I purchased this TV from Walmart last night, so I took it out the box and when I plugged it up, there was a big black square box with a white line covering half of the screen and the TV did not look well made...kind of flimsy. So, I immediately put it back in the box and drove back to Walmart and exchanged it for one that was $10.00 more. I'm glad some of you are happy with your TV, but I was not. The one that I exchanged it for is working great!"
"I purchased this tv for my father who is a senior citizen and cant afford cable or internet service costs. I noticed it had an adapter in it yhat was supposed to be useful if an antenna was going to be used for tv. I bought an antenna that was supposed to pick up the free broadcasting local tv channels up to 60miles and only scanned in 20 channels. None of them were channels that are 2 thru 13. Disappointed in the antenna thing
AND this tv was not eligible for any service plan coverage or offered at time of purchase???"
"I love the fact that this TV allows you to connect from a mobile device if you’ve lost your or misplaced your remote. One additional fact about the TV is that if you have already signed up for cable service, it allows you to load that particular program as an app, therefore giving you the freedom of wires and set top boxes. The clarity of the images are great, even outdoors. The sound quality could be improved somewhat, but nonetheless gets the job done. We have TV consistently through our home and makes it easily from the perspective of the “one remote” system as well as connecting from any device. One other great feature is that if you have little ones that watch TV, it allows you to connect headphones through their app, creating sound on..."
"Easy to use, great picture, connects to all of the apps I want. The only negative is the speakers, they can't even be turned up a quarter of the max volume or they start to vibrate and echo. If you have a surround sound system already then this won't be an issue for you. Still a great buy for the price, and I love my TV."
"This TV was great for the kids room until it wasn't. Stopped connecting to Wifi one day after using it previously in the day with no issue. Went through every troubleshooting step I could find online, nothing worked. Had the internet company come out to test the connections after TCL ""support"" (who are absolutely worthless and just reading off a script) told me the wifi signal was weak. Guess what? It's not. Last try at a fix, factory reset left the TV a useless paperweight. Barely had this for a year and a half."
I love this TV so much. In fact I own two of them now. The media center on here is so easy and intuitive. I use it primarily for Netflix and itâs so simple to navigate there. The TV is very responsive. Very clear picture. The remote is even well-made. I highly recommend this TV. Probably buying another one in fact for my bedroom. For the price itâs about as good as it gets.
"We bought two of these ask Christmas gifts for our children. We have had them for over 2 years now and they are still working great! We primarily use them for Netflix, YouTube, and PS4. Both TV's are mounted on the wall, but we have used the legs before as well. The legs are easy to remove and install making the TV very versatile. Also, it's handing that we can download Roku remotes on their tablets/mobile devices because we misplace the remotes often. You can navigate the screens with the buttons on the TV, but since ours are mounted on the wall, my children can hardly reach them."
"Awful. Do not waste your money! Screen started to go out a couple months after purchased. Walmart customer service told me to contact the manufacturer, so I replaced the tv with the exact model at Walmart and contacted TCL. I get home and plug it in and that screen had already gone out on my 2nd TV. Neither the manufacturer or Walmart would assist me with the first television because I did not know my date of purchase or have a receipt from 2 months prior."
"This has been a great little TV for my needs. Had it for over a year now with no problems. The color is good for a 720p, apps are fast enough (not lightning fast though), and at 60hz keeps up with my xbox one. However the screen is not very bright so if its anywhere near sunlight the picture can be hard to see. Also I bought it for 135 a year ago without it being on special so if you're getting it bc you think it's on sale... yeah just be aware. Still a good deal imo."
"If you use broadcast TV, yes, this has a tuner.  However the designers chose to make it a waste; I, like most, need to switch between antennas or rotate the antenna to get even close local broadcasts.  We've had 3 prior sets (have 2 others now) which work properly, one can scan to add channels.  TCL chose to omit that ability.

If you use an antenna, RUN, DON'T WALK the other way.  This is a nice paperweight, nothing more."
Bought this tv and for 3 hours tried to get it connected to the internet. Tcl customer support is a joke. I did everything they said and the internet suggested and it still would not connect. When trying to connect it shows mac address is 00:00:00:0:00 which means somewhere it is corrupted and will never work. I even connected to a computer and updated software. That didnât work either. Ended up returning it and getting a better brand tv. Other brand connected to wifi in 10 seconds.
"I absolutely love this tv there are so many options and its completely wifi connected so no cable!! Best decision i have made and i definitely recommend, the only thing i wish were different is the volume, I would prefer it to be just a little bit louder but other than that it’s an amazing product"
"Setup was a little bit confusing, but after I called customer support, I was able to easily finish setup by them talking me through it. Volume buttons are on the side of the remote, making it difficult to adjust. Crisp colors and picture. Only had tv for a week, but so far very pleased with it. Seems like a good tv for the price"
"I bought this TV thinking I would have free Roku! Not! During setup it gave me code to get activation. Did not accept code. Had to call Roku and was told I had to pay $79.00 activation fee. I told them the TV screen said "" Free Roku "". The user manual said the same. I paid the fee and instantly had Roku. It amazes me that I never heard about Roku for it is great! Hundreds of movie, TV shows,  music News scources and more. I am so happy with it. The RCA TV has a perfect picture and the sound is better than my 55 inch TV. Going to call Walmart and get my money back if I can."
"This has good specifications and is a good TV to watch Streaming services but terrible if you also want to watch Cable TV channels.  The remote that comes with the TV does not allow you to change channels.  You have to use your cable TV remote to change channels.  Whenever you power on the TV, it comes up with the TCL (Roku) home screen.  You then have to use the Roku remote to select Cable TV after each power on if you want to watch cable TV.   So, you need two remotes in order for this TV to fully function.   The initial setup is extremely complex and requires Internet access using a PC or phone to complete.  Roku asks for a Credit Card number to complete the setup although you can bypass this (with difficulty).  Also, the user manual is ..."
"There was a crack in the screen of the television. I tried returning it at Walmart but couldn't because I didn't have the warranty. I need a tv because I live alone and need something for my sanity, so didn't want to do the shipping thing. I will never order anything like that online ever again. It's a lite scratch. Can't take a picture because it's larger than 5MB"
This is the worst TV I ever had! I never knew a TV could be this bad as it’s all just basic functionality. My brother had a larger TV the same brand and loved it so I decided to get one for my bedroom. I was excited at first… Until problems started to arise. If you do anything quickly which usually the TV won’t allow to do meaning try to put the volume up fast or channel fast you can’t because the TV does not recognize fast. It takes FOREVER to load anything!!!!  It has tested my patience for way too long! the sound does not match up to the person talking and then it takes forever for The TV to connect to the sound and it takes forever once you push an app for it too load and sometimes it just shuts off. This is a problem for my autistic so...
"Absolutely love the TV. It's so clear and it's a great size for my living room. I love being able to have all my apps on here and hooking up cable was so simple. I'm even able to use this as a second monitor for work, which is nice because of the amount of room.

The one thing I don't like, the sensor bar is way too small! The remote has to be pointed right at it or it doesn't pick anything up. 

Otherwise I highly recommend this TV."
"Bought this when my other 32 in. bit the dust. Very easy to hook up, picture is really good and I am real happy with the sound. Having the smart TV capability already in the TV makes it much easier. Very happy with the purchase and the price is great!! I would purchase this again. I may get a sound bar for surround sound later on, for now I like the option for different sound options on the TV. Picture is crisp for a 720p. I would reccomend this product."
"Absolute garbage. Completely stopped working 6 months into having it, obviously thats outside of the 90 day return policy so Im stuck having to buy a new tv. So much is wrong with this tv, between audio lags, apps crashing, and the light at the bottom that flashes every single time you press a button. I will never buy another TCL."
"Initial review:
TV purchased and set up on Sunday 3/24/19.
This was the third try to get the ""right"" TV setup for my bedroom.
First was an Insignia 19-inch set from Best Buy, with a not-very-old Roku Express device. Discovered the Roku was bad (they make awful hardware), so it was discarded and the Insignia returned.
Decided a smart TV was the way to go, specifically a Roku TV, and decided on a Philips 32-inch model, purchased a few days before this TV.
That TV had a panel with poor backlight/gray uniformity and somewhat limited connection options.
I returned that set to Walmart on 3/24 and left the store with this TCL.
I love the Roku TV operating system for televisions. All sets should have it, everybody should prefer it.
I am pleased wit..."
"I love the tv and how easy it is to navigate. My 3 year old daughter is even able to navigate and use the remote. The only issue I had was my tv being left outside my door as I live in apartments. They do not require a signature so b very mindful of the shipping date. Other than that, just go pick it up although pick up took longer than getting delivered."
"bought this brand tv over a year ago and no big huge issue, but lately it's been kicking itself off Wi-Fi and restarts itself 

everything else is fine but that one issue so far

oh and the volume button on the remote went out a week after purchased so I have to use the Roku remote app on my phone to change volume"
"had an old flat screen tv and decided to upgrade. This is a great tv and I have received many ""where did you buy that at"".  The set up was very easy all I did was put on the legs and plug it in; the tv did the rest. The legs are optional and the tv book tells you what type of tv mount you need.  I like the way the remote control fits into your hand."
"I bought this tv for my living room and it's had nothing but problems from the start. First thing is not being able to connect to Internet almost daily. I have to search my internet enter my pass word and restart  everyday. The last week I've had todo a factory reset. It has nothing to do with the internet connection because my other tv runs just fine. 
I'm so disappointed in this tv and would not recommend it to anyone."
This is the 3rd tv ive ever owned and it will be the last. This one the smart tv apps were super laggy and wheres the search bar for new apps? I used my firs stick then it was super fast but then it would always act up. Then my fire stick remote stopped working. Then the tv remote stopped working. Even a new vizio remote wouldnt work. Customer service was kind and i can return it no problems since its only been 50 days since i bought it. Thats why i gave it 2 stars.
"Dont pay attention to the bad reviews. This is the best TV we have ever purchased and the price is amazing. This tv is super portable too, it's so light we bring it all over our house, garage, back yard. After initial setup you can move it anywhere and just plug in and you're good to go. 

People having issues with their wifi should call the wifi carrier and not complain on here. We had set back with our old AT"
I have purchased two of these now.  I especially love the vivid bright picture on them. The sound is perfect to. I love that it comes with all the Roku apps and the Roku store. It is so easy to find apps right in the Roku store. Many of them are free with television programming and movies. It also has many of the latest updated apps. I like that I can watch programming on one Roku television and finish watching it on another TV in my house. This is very easy stream my favorite shows. These are the best television sets that I have had and I definitely recommend them.
"Walmart doesn't honor their warranty purchases on any type of electronic, that's why we bought the 3 year warranty just incase of an accident. My wife and I weren't home, and there wasn't anyone else at our house, after we got home and turned it on it was cracked in the corner and through the center."
"I have only had this TV for a year and I have to reset or unplug it almost daily due to distorted sound. When this first started I thought it was my internet connection, but the router is in the same room.  The systems are all updated, and I have found numerous others with this same issue."
I would not recommend this TV.  It has only one HDMI port and therefore I could not cast to the TV from my desktop or from my iphone.  The remote is really crappy:  It is hard to use:  One time I wanted to watch news but could only find find movies:  I never could find news.  It's hard to regulate the sound and even to turn the TV off:  The last day I watched it I got an important phone call but could not hear it because I could not turn down sound and also could not turn off the TV.  :-(
"I wanted a new TV to avoid cropping issues on my SNES. This device has far exceeded my expectations and my needs. I love that you can preview your input devices in the Roku menu. I also love the smart home integration, but I wish Google Home supported more than one Roku at a time."
I have refused to pay hundreds of dollars a month for cable TV! Now with Internet and my ROKU TV I get as many of (or more than) the same channels as relatives who have ATT OR SPECTRUM! I only have one problem: I have become addicted! Love it! The television itself was so reasonable now I wish I had gone larger! I am saving my pennies for a 40” as a treat at Christmas. Slow going onSocial Security but I'll get there! I recommend it to everyone!
"TV is great, bought the 32"" for our Granddaughter's room. Pretty easy setting it up on our wireless. This thing even gets our cable channels through our wifi! How awesome is that. Seriously think we'll be getting the larger one to replace our 60"" LG and another for the bedroom."
I just really like the TCL Roku TV’s. I now have 3 of them. They have a Great picture and sound. The only thing I would change on this setup is the remote. The remote could be a little bigger. I hit every button around the OK button. But besides that it’s a Great setup. Thanks TCL for a Great Product!!
"I bought this tv last oct 16 21
After one month and half the tv trun on and off by it self 
I tried to return to Walmart walmart didn’t accept it Because more than 30 days which is not fair 
Call customer service tcl tv which always close or estimated time for waiting 6 minutes and they hold you 1-2 hours waiting after that close 
I tried to do everything reset and reset factory tried everything online to fix without 
Any luck 
Don’t buy it spend some money by other vendor 
Believe me is not worth it"
"Ok I had tv a year now and it CONSTANTLY kicks me out of what I’m watching …it could be the beginning ,middle of movie or the end it just kicks me out. I have a LG tv in living room I have never experienced this problem I will never buy another TCL!!"
"I received the 32"" TCL tv for a Christmas present 2 years ago. I was very pleased with the tv. The picture was very good. The smart functions worked great. But the tv did not last two years before problems started. Horizontal lines stared appearing and the bottom quarter of the tv would become disconnected from the rest of the picture, making it very difficult to enjoy watching the tv."
"I've had this tv for over a year now, and I absolutely hate it! It has good video quality, but takes several minutes to connect to the internet each time I try to use it. Trying to use the remote is so slow, it is almost painful. Also, it crashes and restarts randomly for no discernable reason. I've seen the same issues addresses on numerous blogs, but have yet to see a decent solution to the problem. Consider buying a different device, if you can find one."
"While I have been burned by other off-brand model flatscreens, this TCL smart tv is fairly good. The picture is bright and clear, the stock speakers are surprisingly decent, and the viewing angle is pretty good. While the resolution is only 720, the price was under $120 so I am not complaining. It was not that long ago that $100 only bought you a no-name 19"" flatscreen with a washed out colors, anemic viewing angles, and pathetic stock speakers.  So this is a really good deal. This is a perfect tv for folks on a budget or for the kid's room."
I bought this one for my room. it's a good bedroom TV. the sound quality is good and the picture quality is pretty average hd. I chose the Roku tv because we're a Roku family. I didn't feel a need for a TV and separate Roku box. the tv itself looks really good and takes up very little space.
"Bought this TV because:
a. Size of the TV fit nicely above one of my shop windows.
b. Easy to use with wifi in my detached shop with router being in main home.
c. Spectrum Cable app allows me to have the equivalent of cable entirely wireless.

Primary weakness are the built in speakers, although plan to buy Roku wireless speakers soon.


Some concern about how durable the remote is as you tend to use it a lot. I have same TV in main home for over a year and its been solid."
"Bought this TLC 32 inch for my daughters birthday and TV works fine but Roku smart tv 3 series don’t connect to app not working. Or I’m doing something wrong tried to connect with my lap top and my phone account maybe app in tv not working. I will try next 3 days if it don’t connect we’ll return tv, has issues everything else works. Nice picture quality"
"Freezes when you try to watch Netflix, the remote doesn’t work unless you’re within 5 feet and directly in front of the tv. The volume is so insanely out of wack, even after adjusting it in settings. Hulu has to be muted when playing commercials unless you want your eardrums ruptured and Netflix has to be turned up all the way just to hear it. Same with DVD players, tv has to be turned up full vol and still so low you can’t hear it. Just pay the extra $20 for the Phillips, which we also have and is perfect."
Excellent TV for the price!!!
Didn't order a 30ish inch tv..but still charged my card
"I haven't even gotten it yet, and all I can say is ""What a piece of crap!"""
Bought this tv in 2019.  Black screen in 2022.  Won't buy again.
"New in box, got home and unboxed plug in and ABSOLUTELY nothing.  would not recommend"
ordered this tv for the kids today and was here tonight was definitely surprising i love Wal-Mart
i bought on sat got it next day walmart is great
My TV cam destroyed. That’s my review. 130$ down the drain
i like it up and running in my bedroom
happpy thank you sooo much
I don’t like how he left on sidewalk
Great TV works out of the box easy to set up
damaged item very poor quality
I am technically “challenged” but this was so easy to set up.  I think Roku TV is the way to go.
Great picture. Easy to use. Love being able to control up close on my phone as opposed to trying to read from across the room.
my daughter bought me one for my birthday a couple years ago. works great I haven't had any problems. I plan on getting a second one now.
My tv would go out every time it rained. Now I use the cell phone hot spot and get more channels and don't have a cable bill anymore.
Cant use this tv without paying for registration. We were told $64.00 to register this through roku customer service. Returned this tv
great tv for about 30days  then lost all sound stillhas a good picture  going to return for same model
"Great TV for the price, especially since it's a smart TV. It has a good color and sound. My son plays his PlayStation on it daily."
Was quite impressed. First time being able to stream. Am enjoying the ability to catch up on episodes missed
Super lightweight! We are using it outside. So easy to hook up and use! We take it back inside when we are done.
"Audio sucks, drives me crazy goes in and out, no setting makes it better. I wish I had spent a little more, would have been worth it."
I love this TV I can get on tubi or Netflix on the big screen instead of my phone and it's all built in love it love it love it everyone should own at least one I own 4
VERY VERY UN-HAPPY! Bought the tv in the store got home to set up and the Tv is Badly Damaged! it's not usable. Going to exchange it tomorrow if there are any other TV's available!
"Recently, my granddaughter purchased my Roku Smart TV . I think my rating explains it all. I love the quality of the picture and ease of access to all my streaming services especially, the Roku Channel. Everyone must have at least one. . . :)"
"You get what you paid for. Nothing more, but it delivers what you need. It does suck up bandwidth so if you have a slow internet connection this TV may not be for you."
The new ROKU tv is like a smart phone for tv viewing! It has SO MANY “app” like choices for FREE viewing options! The “ROKU CHANNEL” has TONS of FREE popular movies to watch! I LOVE it!
This devise allows for options the cable networks do not have. The associated cost is significantly less. It will be unlikely the cable networks will be able to compete with this product.
"I really enjoy utilizing it as it is a nice system. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to explore it, friendly savvy, and I like the many options."
tv looked nice and I think would of had a clear image IF we could get it to connect to the network. The tv interface kept freezing so we could never get past the first set up screen.
I paid $118 for this set and have no complaints. Easy set up and I'm no techie. If you aren't a big gadget person and just looking for a TV that works this will suit you fine. The price was definitely right.
"Purchased this TV for my camper.  Inexpensive, light weight, good picture and lots of program options.  I have a satellite dish and box to stay connected on long trips."
"This television is awesome. I just had to re buy it because i cracked the screen. When i tell you this television has many apps, it has. Definitely worth the money spent."
Terrible. stopped working after 45 days. Google 'TCL sounds works but no picture' and you'll see that everyone who buys this thing ends up with this problem. couldn't return it. no one should buy this poorly built TV
"Item came in perfect condition, fast shipping. The only thing I didnt like it is that it doesnt come with the wall mount screws, but the instruction booklet says wich screws it uses"
Love how easy to set up and navigate to the app you wish to view. This is my second Roku which was brought for a bedroom when grandkids stay over night.
"It’s a great tv, except for the fact that it will easily break. I had my tv for about 3 months and when I was cleaning my stand for the tv the tv almost fell off, but I caught it. When I turned on my tv, it was completely broken."
"If I could, I would give this zero stars. Here it is CHRISTMAS morning and my son opens this t.v. and it DOESNT WORK! WONT EVEN TURN ON! Thanks for the great christmas memories walmart and tcl."
Was very affordable and compares in quality to more expensive televisions. I recommend them to all my friends and family purchasing a new smart television.
This is a great tv. We bought one for our child’s bedroom. The picture is clear. The only comment I have is the box does not tell you that there is a remote in it. So it makes it appear that you have to purchase one separately.
"it's decent for the price, got it mainly to use with Alexa, sad to say, it does NOT work with Alexa. So, if you were planning on it working with echo, echo dot, or anything Alexa related, it doesn't...even though it claims to in description."
The quality of the picture is passable but not the best. I only bought this so my son could watch TV while recovering from an infection that kept him off his feet
"I really like this product, smart TVs are the best way to watch now since you have pretty much everything at your disposal. Live TV, Hulu etc it’s a great investment and makes everything cheaper for you overall."
I love the tv all the way around!! All the apps very easy to use my 4 year old can even use it with no problem !!! Its a great tv and worth every penny
This is our fourth time purchasing this TV. It's the only brand we buy - it's so lightweight and the picture is super crisp and the Roku is ready to go!
"only last 1 year. I have a 50"" and the screen goes black every year. we had to get it replaced last year and surprise surprise we have to do it again this year. The person that came last time even said he replaces this tv multiple times a week."
Works well and easy To set up and navigate . Only issue has been with keeping Netflix on and getting it to work - can be very slow and cut out and re boot itself when on Netflix
We bought the tv for our bedroom and have been very pleased with it overall. We were not use to the ruku system so that took some getting use too. The tv is a great value for anyone looking to get a smart tv for the first time like we were.
Great tv - perfect for my boyfriends daughter's room at her grandma's house. Super easy to set up... you don't have to pay anything (which I've read from previous reviews) which is nice.
I bought this tv months ago worked great never a problem until I unplugged it and pugged it straight into the wall.......Moral of this little story buy the best surge protector power strip you can buy any electronics need protection...never again.
I love my roku TV. It's the perfect size and for a great price. It's high quality and you can get anything on it from Netflix to Youtube to Spotify. It also has 3 HDMI ports (one ARC) and you can hook up AV or antenna TV.
I have had the Roku TV for 3 months now and I enjoyed it so far. You can pick the type of channels you want in your TV would tell people who are thinking of switching to a smart TV that this is a good beginner starter.
"So I bought this TV tonight. I get it home and I set it up, then it asks me to put in my credit card info...just to find out that I'll be charged $30 a month to watch Netflix, prime etc...not happy returning tomorrow!"
"Wanted a snall TV for my bedroom. Sold cheap, picture is crisp, menu is responsive, and comes loaded with Roku software, which includes a wide breadth of available streaming services."
"I do not have a year with this TV and the screen from one day to another only looks black, I can not see anything just listen to the sound of the program."
Great picture and easy setup. Bought this for great granddaughters to have in their bedroom when they spend the next get . Already used it and it worked out great. Just right size for bedrooms.
I was very disappointed in this product. They did not make it clear that you have to have a roku account when purchasing this. The account is not cheap and it's absurd and disappointing that it was not mentioned in the description section.
i dont like it. the tv remote barely works and the tv freezes up. the tv wouldn't stay turned off so I've unplugged it ad left it. id reccomend getting a roku.
"I love my Roku T.V.  This is my second. I was a little upset that this one cost about $30 more than the first one I bought a few years ago, but it _has_ been a few years. Easy to set up; easy to  navigate. Good, clear picture, decent sound."
"I can’t say enough great things about this tv! It’s absolutely perfect for a small space, like a bedroom or dorm room. Picture quality is wonderful and the sound is fantastic, crystal clear! Would recommend 10/10!"
"Very easy to get it up and running.  The picture quality is good and the price was great.  I've only had it for about a week as of 7/21/19, but so far so good!"
"It took me some time to get the TV figured out.  Granted I am 63yo and I don't learn as fast as I used to.  This TV worked as it's supposed to and has a good quality picture and sound.  For the price, this TV is well worth it."
"The tv is thin and light and functions great, but the remote buttons are impossible to tell where your fingers are. It's basically a big circle with no raised buttons."
This is a great little tv for a child. The app optiona are great and the remote makes it easy for a 5 year old to navigate! The picture quality is good for the price to. Considering getting another one for my kitchen!
"The TCL Roku TV is a tremendous value. The picture quality is surprisingly good at the price and it's very easy to use. 

This TV is being used in an office setting to display high resolution photos. The clarity and depth is great."
"My daughter loves this tv. It was her early Christmas gift. It has a very good picture. Love the fact that it was so easy to set up, no fighting with wires and cables. It arrived two days early which was great for her. Thank you."
Love this tv great quality and works amazing couldn't ask for a nicer picture for the price of the tv only thing I don't like is you have to subscribe to each app and pay each app separate
"Not kid friendly. My son is autistic and smacked the screen and it cracked. We had the tv for 2 weeks. Currently looking for another Vizio or Westinghouse , both have lasted over 8 years."
"Amazing TV, works very well. The resolutio is clear and the volum is high. The price is perfect. The screen is clear. It is easy to navigate and set up."
I have 3 of these TVs!  Two of the 32 inches and the 43 inch one!  They work wonderfully and the pic is clear or clear enough for me.  Easy to use and set-up.  Helped me cut the cable cord!
"Great tv, excellent picture quality; easy to set up and apps. My only suggestion to make the product better is for the remote to include a guide fuction so you dont have to go through every channel."
The TV didn't work out of the box.  When I contacted support they wanted a credit card number to provide assistance!  I have bought my first and last TCL Roku product.
I honestly love my tv i really just wanna know if i can bluetooth stuff to it. I have a bluetooth keyboard that i would like to connect to my tv but dont know how! Please someone help me with this!!!!
"I had never heard of the brand before and 8 was skeptical but for the price we went for it. So glad we did, this is a great little TV and has good sound and picture.  Easy to set up and use"
"I'm very happy with our TLC Roku TV. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. Its easy to use and u have a lot to choose from, movies, tv, live tv."
We've only had this TV for a few months and it already burned out. The screen turned all into ask white lines and then went black and now there's no screen at all. DO NOT buy this brand!! First and last that I'll ever purchase from Tcl.
TV works great I bought 2 one for kids room and one for my room...I like it bc it has netflix and youtube installed in it all ready...so my kids dont need to have the xbox turned on in order to have Netflix and youtube
Quick and convenient. Tamara brought out my purchase and was very cheerful and friendly. Something that is missing in the retail world these days with self checkouts. Human interaction.
I was shocked to find a TV with built in Roku for the price I did. I bought the TV for my 6 year old. She is able to use the TV and Roku features with no problems. the Roku platform is easy to use with no issues or hangups.
I love my Roku TV. It is easy to use for people who are not necessarily tech savvy. It has great apps you can download and games to play on your tv for free. I would recommend this tv to anyone who asks me about a smart tv.
"Honestly, it's affordable and great but the only thing I didn't like was that the remote control does not have any number buttons. It's really annoying having to scroll through a bunch of channels just to find the one you want."
"Hate this tv!! The sensor for the remote is toooo sensitive. If you're not in the exact right spot, it doesn't register. So irritating!!! Picture is great tho"
"great tv bought for my son he loves it just a little confusing to use the remote if your technologically disabled lol tv actually seems bigger then my older 32"" the thin frame makes it perfect"
This is my first TCL/RokuTV and I have to say I was throughly surprised. I love the interface and simplicity of use. As of now I have zero complaints.
"Complete waste of money.  The remote is absolutely useless, they may as well not even include it.  The sound on the TV stopped working 6 months after we bought it."
"I bought this TV and live it, so I bought one for my son's family 6 months ago for Christmas.  The sound pops in and out, they are not happy with it at all!!"
"At first I thought I had got the TV until I get it hooked up and after get it going , I was excited about all the other things it could do . Great brand !!!"
"I like this TV I've had mines for over a year and I haven't had any problems with it..
the remote is small but when you go into the menu there's a lot of features there"
Great TV for the money. Bought 2 of them for the kids. They both love them. You can download spectrum cable app and then you don't have to deal with cable boxes or more wires.
We bought this tv around 6 months ago for our RV. It has a beautiful picture and is so easy to use. And is very light weight which is important when you travel and live in an RV full time. I highly recommend buying this tv.
It's a great TV for the price but when playing any streaming and using the fast forward button it takes forever. I am unable to fast forward by long pressing the remote. The remote only works if I keep pressing it at intervals.
"Good picture, many useful apps. I only have WiFi at home and I utilize apps like Pluto and Netflix. also like that you can download an app that allows me to use my phone for a remote and allows private listening"
"Since cancelled our cable,  needed a bedroom tv so we could still watch movies etc.  Hooked up HD antenna and kepted wifi.  Now get hundreds of shows/movies free."
"I was hesitant to purchase a smart-tv since it would be my first one. However, this one is easy to set-up, program, move around & I got it @ a good price."
"I've had the 32"" 32S301 for less than 1 year, actually I bought 3 and the speakers/volume no longer works. I had never owned a TCL and I thought I would try it, up to now I was happy, but for the cost I expect a TV to last longer than 1 year."
"I love my new Roku tv !! I had a Roku stick for my old tv but I had the old one since 2014, I got the stick in 2020 I like it I did but I love that the Roku is actually built into the tv itself! I absolutely love it"
I love my tv. It's easy to work. The picture qualty is good. Even the sound quality. The remote is easy to work. The Tv has a decent different channels. I love it.
"The TV worked great for about 3 weeks and then for no reason the picture just went out, right in the middle of a movie. It wasn't knocked around or dropped, it just went out one day."
"Great  TV especially for the price.  Easy use remote and great color.  Sure is a plus that this Roku TV can handle many, many apps.
Will be buying another soon for the guest bedroom."
This Television is Awesome... Went in Kitchen 4 Wife... It is Like a Big Smart Phone... Easy to Screen Mirror... Has Lightning Fast Speed on Slow Internet... I will Put These Throughout the Whole House...
"I was skeptical at first because of the price being under the other sets I was looking at I'm not at all tech savvy, so I was extremely pleased with how easy set up and installation was the additional features has fit my needs perfectly."
"So easy to set up, ready to go in just a few minutes.  Great picture and sound quality.  So many options with Roku...lots of free channels, local news, movies.   Cut the cable or keep it this is a great TV."
I love my TCL it is very convenient to use we actually own three. Everyone can stream what they enjoy watching in every room at the same time. Thank you for an awesome product.
"Perfect size for a bedroom or smaller area.  The screen is crisp and the sound is good, too.  Love the Roku app that comes with it. Very light and easy to handle."
"I bought this TV for my bedroom. Loved it so much, I bought 3 more for my kids for Christmas. They work great, good coloring, good volume, at a good price. Lots of channel/app options"
"I have purchased 3 of these. They are problem free, easy to use, offer all of the apps I need and out ""do"" my other really expensive tv's in the house. You can't go wrong for the price."
I bought this tv for my son 3 years ago and it still works the same way as the first day I bought it. It’s very easy to use and you definitely get your money’s worth. I have never had any issues with this tv and I highly recommend it!
Ended up returning this because the picture quality was really washed out no matter what setting we tried. Replaced it with a Phillips of the same size for the same price and the colors are amazing!
I liked how everything associated with my other tcl tv automatically transferred over once I signed in. I will definitely buy another tcl in the near future.
"I purchased this for my son's room and we all comment on how his is the clearest tv in the house. Great little tv, have been looking at a bigger one for our family room."
"Too much money for screen size. Works great. Good sound. Good picture. Good color. Ok, just too expensive for my budget for what I got. Cheapest they had in stock though, so better than nothing."
I love the Roku smart.  It does everything I need it to do but at a fraction of the cost of other smart tv's.  This is the second one I bought.  One for each guest bedroom.
I bought this TV to go in my grandkids room when they visit.  I will also be able to use it in my Camper Having the Built-in roku is going to be great
"I dont think i have this exact model as i bought mine 4 years ago but its still working great and i love it. I see reviews that other peoples broke after a year or two, buy the walmart warranty, i always buy the extended warranty"
"Easy to use right out of the box. It took a few adjustments to get the picture right, but everything else has been easy and effective. It is easy to navigate, and all the apps work great. I couldn't be more happier."
"Open boxes. look to make sure items are complete. Appearently I paid for a unwrapped, screws thrown in the box, no care given to this TV.  I am disappointed. This was my 2nd TV purchase."
We needed a new tv for a spare bedroom when I saw this one on sale. I was surprised at the quality of this tv for the price. The picture and sound are great!
Great tv I bought it for my granddaughter room so she had something to watch whe she came over to stay at night she loves it. She can have her Hulu and Netflix.
"Do not buy this tv. We bought it last year and have constant issues since. It randomly turns off, words constantly off from picture, remote only half the time works."
"no android , IPTV or mirroring. You can't add channels as you want. very very limited options. You need to buy other roku devices otherwise nothing will work with it"
The tv would have been cool if I actually received a remote to it . I don't even want it anymore I've tried to download apps to help me control it and nothing can sync with this tv .
I love this tv! Ive had one since Black Friday of 2016 and it has amazing quality picture. The appa you can get for it are also great and seemingly endless!
"I have only had this TV for a day, but love it so far! The picture is much clearer than my old box-style TV. Setup was a breeze. It is so convenient having Roku and other apps built in."
This all in one tv is a lot easier than having a separate roku box and regular tv. I especially like that I can control the volume which is something that wasn't available with the older roku remotes.
Had this t.v. for less then 2 months. Only used maybe 10 times. Went to turn it on and have no power. Tried to take back to Wal-Mart. They said they only return up to 15 days. Total crap!
The item is worth the cost that it was purchased for.  The picture quality is great.  I had to contact a customer service representative with TCL-Roku and they were extremely patient and helpful.
"TCL + Roku TV. The price is good. Image quality is amazing. Lightweight, convenient, conect wiressly to my modem and I can connect to my cable company and see tv live. No wire messes to deal with. I love it."
I bought the tv today and am very happy with it so far  the only issue I had is my Netflix would not load right away but I tried it later and it went right through  great tv thank you
Tv worked great at first but when they start to go out they have WiFi connection issues and the customer support blames it on your isp. I went a bought a new tv (not tcl) and it connected just fine.
This tv is defective. Within 24 hrs of purchasing it kept turning off by itself. I have been in contact with the manufacture and followed all their troubleshooting steps but nothing has fixed the problem.
It does the job of a $135 TV. It cant be left on for more than a couple of hours or the TV stops responding to remote commands. It will switch itself from whatever Im watching back to the Home screen
I just got this tv and it works great! I love it :D the price is amazing for what you get and the picture is very nice + there are a lot of free movies and shows !!!
"This tv works great for about 3 months then you’ll start to get a dark screen. TCL customer service is useless, you can go on google and see how many people searches “TCL TV dim/dark screen”"
The picture quality is very good.  The remote is easy to use and everything was easy to set up.  I would like to get another slightly larger one for a different room.  I am very pleased.
Small package with many great opinions; love the built in for Roku streaming; great feature and the system was extremely user friendly and easy to set up.
"Bought this tv in store, the box was in perfect shape. Got home and unboxed the tv, plugged it in and the screen was shattered. Will be returning it today."
"We bought a second smaller screen for the bedroom after buying one for our main viewing room. They are great price, excellent picture and easy to set up. Have had no problems with these tv's."
Bought 9-10-2020. The remote is not gonna last long. Real cheezy remote. My other tvs dont have built in roku. And those remotes are made totally different not cheezy. I wouldn't buy again. Now to look where to buy a new one from.
"I never heard of this brand Television. Got it, set it up in no time. Easy follow instructions. Picture is perfect. Very satisfied. WalMart delivered the product next day."
"Great TV for the price. Crisp picture and sound.  The only issue is the TV receiver for the remote is so small its difficult to control the TV if not directly in front of it, which becomes frustrating."
Bought one back in 2018 still a great tv. I'm only leaving a review because of the price increase. These TCL 32in TVs used to be $118-$130 dollars ..They are nearly $200 now? Why? I was looking for a 40in for about $150...Not anymore.
"I've had this TV for 1yr. Good picture, sound ,quality, price. After a yr the picture tube is gone. I would buy another but now I'm scare the same thing will happen again. TCL help!!"
"love this brand have 2 a 32"" and a 50"" so far so good have had for 5 months works well great sound and picture and great apps. I have no trouble with apps and streaming!"
Personally one of favorites out of all of Roku Products. Works properly and has no issues and was easy to setup! I have two different brands but the Roku portion is the best part about them!
I've only had this hooked up for 3 days now however this is perfect for what I bought it for! I bought two of these for my young children. We have a cable company that uses ROKU so I saved money on cable boxes as well!
"Roku setup was easy and worked well, but the tv watching was interrupted by pops, flashes, and scrambled image. Reconnected the old smaller flat screen tv and it worked fine.

Returned it got the LG for the same price. Works great."
Had it 5 months and the sound is stuck in headphones mode and won’t work. We have called and tech support is a joke for this product. They read from a script. Nothing worked and nobody called us back. Don’t waste your money on this tv!
"Good TV, purchased for kidâs room. There is a light that stays on when the TV is turned off. Its just emough to be annoying when youâre sleeping in a room with thr TV. Kinda weird that this would be a feature on the TV."
"Turns it self on and off randomly through out the day, tried updating it, tried resetting it, didnt work. It like comes on goes to setting and then presses turn off tv"
My roku tv is all I need. I enjoy watching different channels everyday. You have the best apps to pick from..... I literally stay in my room all day watching my tv.
"We bought this to replace our 5 year old LG set that quit on us. It wasn’t hard to set up, but it won’t work with our Direct TV remote so we’ve got to use two remotes now. I also don’t like the tv remote because the volume controls are on the side, not on the front with the rest of the buttons, so it’s a little awkward  to adjust the volume. The picture adjustment is also off, for a lot of channels there’s a black frame around the picture and for others, it fills the entire screen. This is with any of the screen adjustment settings.  I suppose that’s an issue with a lot of tvs though. 
For the price, though, it’s not a bad tv."
"I haven’t bought this tv yet. I have no idea as to it’s quality. I will get another tv because mine quit working after a couple of years. I prefer a stupid tv but I guess you can only get smart ones now. I’m not smart so why does my tv have to be smart? When I get a new tv, and it will probably be this one, I will most likely not do a review. Although I do think it’s nice to be able to review a product I have not even seen."
Great picture and sound. I purchased 3 more at a wonderful price very satisfied with this tv.
"Love it! No complaints!\n\nGood picture, good sound!"
It's very nice. Excellent picture. Great price. Easy to set up.
Not happy at all tv in home 4 days and screen crashed as if something internal broke
DO NOT BUY> You cant activate as a smart tv without roku subscription costing $100/year
Setup was a snap!  Great picture quality and sound. Love this tv for my bedroom!!
Great tv. Only took about 10 minutes to set up. Easy to follow directions. Great picture and sound.
Set up was perfect but sound does not work at all even after reset. Bad buy.
Bought this tv in April and speakers were broken/inaudible by June.  No sound ! Terrible quality.
Love the TV it's amazing it's pretty loud to love it.
Works great for about a year. Then starts freezing up while streaming. For a 'smart TV this is a fail.
"with this tv i'm able to all my new and old tv shows, along with tv content from other countries. this is a great tv."
I like it but itâs a little smaller than 32 inches so 29 inches but itâs still nice And excellent Screen And it came earlyï¿¼
This is the second one I have the first one got damaged in a car accident I like the television extremely well
The tv works and looks fine but within the firsr 10 minutes of watching the remote quit working so now I have to use my phone for a remote.
Love all the features. Great value for the cost. This will save a great amount of money as we sure wont need cable or satellite
"Great TV, I love all the apps that you can download on it, and it's just not for TV shows and movie it also streams music"
My tv is used in my camper in mostly rural areas. I turn my WiFi hot spot and watch whatever I want ! How great is that!
Very pleased with this television and all its features.  Just the right size for my needs! Try the free introductory offers.
For the price I thought the worse... but was very surprised that this tv is way better than my Vizio. It's no the loudest but it's a great tv
"Just what we wanted for the porch. Easy setup, good picture quality and easy to use remote. What's not to like!!"
I gave the TV to my sister. She is really enjoying it! I believe it's a great value for a Roku TV. I also thought the picture was good.
just bought so far it's been a great TV. Would recommend for anyone who's looking for a good secondary 32 inch TV.
"Perfect for a childs room, spare room or outside on a patio.  Worth the price. Hooks up to wifi easy."
I bought this tv and its not allowing me to enter the code i called customer service they are saying i need to pay a one time fee
"The TV is great, the truck that delivered it was ahead of schedule in perfect condition.Iwill do business on line again with you all."
I bought it for my twin 7yr old twins they love it especially the apps That came on the tv. Good picture also.
Really like it. Easy to set up. Even compatible with other roku in the house. I only wish it came in a higher pixel.
It was very easy to set up and start using it. And thankfully it came with batteries for the remote.
States on box 31.5 â  screen is 28â.  Very small. But you get what you pay for. I am returning TV
Would recommend this tv. Got this for my bed no need for cable. Easy to use. Can watch my prime video on it plus 100s more
"Real happy with the TV. Looked at several different brands of smart TV and I liked the picture quality of this one the best, so that's what I bought."
"As I've only had it for a few days it works great.
All hook ups as stated (5 min. max)
Highly Recommended!"
Love the TV and the easy set up for all the apps. The only thing I'm so disappointed it's that you can't switch to the cable TV I have.
Pick this up for my grandchildren to play video games on and it's a smart TV so they can watch Netflix and other good channels they love it
This TV has a beautiful picture and is super easy to navigate.  It was also very easy to get up and running.  Great purchase!
Very light weight. does the job for the price paid. its for my 10 year old daughter and she loves the netflix and youtube app
We bought a new house out of state and purchased this tv to use until we move in permanently several months down the road. With a $8.88 antenna
Awesome television for the price! Works just as well as the other name brands. Can play my Xbox on here just fine
"Smart tv, great value for the price. Easy to set up. Shipping was fast and free. Good experience all around."
I haven't even had this TV for 2 weeks and the entire time I've had it the sounds was garbled and today there's no sound
Good value.  Only complaint is no on or off on the television.  If you lose the remote you have to unplug to turn off.
So light and so easy to connect! I was very surprised by how light the box was and then in about 15 minutes I had it connected.
nice! very nice tv. only wish power cord was about 3 in longer. i have it ontop of an armoire and cord wont reach outlet right behind it.
"This is the best tv I've ever purchased, I'm extremely satisfied with it and would recommend it to everyone!!!!!"
"I love my new TCL Roku Smart TV as it is easy to use, affordable and the resolution is great. Thank you!"
Great TV - great buy the for the money. We've had it over a year - no problems at all - kids love it!
"Very good product so far, but have only had it one week and used only once.  Use this in our church SS.."
"TV is light, set up was easy. Has good picture. Remote needs to be a little bigger with a few extra buttons for easier use."
I had a few 4K tvâs that dont even look as good as this tv I honestly donât know how they make it look so good.
"Great tv, bought as a replacement for my bedroom. Roku was easy to set up and sign into. Well worth the price!"
I love my tv. It has everything and more. The price is just right. You cant beat the price nor the quality of the tv. Everything is right.
"Very easy to use and navigate. I bought it originally for my 5yr old, but my 2yr old uses it as well with no problems."
It is a perfect TV for me with the price and I can watch anything I want because I don't have cable in that room.
"Size is perfect for a bedroom TV. Easy to operate with 3 HDMI inputs, AV inputs and off air signal. Sound is plenty loud. Brightness is perfect."
Glad I picked this tv. I was hesitant not to buy this brand but it was a great decision. Very good tv..built in Roku.
This tv is sold a reasinabke price. I love that roku is already built in with the tv. Less extra stuff. Smart tvs are the best to have.
There is No Activation Fee ! It's a Scam  ! https://www.thecordcutterlife.com/roku-activation-fee-scam/
"We bought this for our daughter, and she loves it. Great size for a studio apartment, and it's easy to set up and operate."
"Awesome TV! When all you have is a home internet connection, you still have limitless entertainment with this TV!"
"We got one 32"" in that had issues so we opt to get another from different refurbished group and this one works great."
I absolutely love this tv. The color is clear and the apps included are so convenient. I'm thinking about purchasing another one!??
I never got to use it thanks to roku unable to set up. Returned tv. Going to buy an LG. They don't have roku. I'm being generous rating a 1 star.
Great TV all around. Really easy for kids to use and set up. We got our TV at a really great price and it's very worth it.
My son got this TV for a Christmas present. So far we have not had any problems. The set up was very easy.
I have 2 of these so far. I gave one away for Christmas almost 2 years ago and it's still in mint condition. So I bought my son one for his room.
If one one the tv not available I’ll substitute it for another one that’s the same as the one available.
This offers a great quality picture and easy to use. Great for the price. Thinking of buying another one.
I love this TV I love all the apps installed. Great quality and affordable. I recommend this smart tv.
"The TV is awesome. Great picture, color and sound. Great purchase for the price and a quality product. You can't go wrong with this TV."
Excellent picture quality. It was very easy to connect to WiFi. Hookup with cable was a breeze. Having my iPhone and iPad as a remote is pretty cool.
"We bought two of these TCL Smart Tvs so far so good. Very easy to setup and easy to use, no complaints yet!!! Keep you posted.."
Love the picture and sound only thing is when you first turn it on you have to choose the input every time but really good buy
"It’s rather small, if that’s what you’re looking for. It’s lightweight. It’s a good tv;however, I do think that it’s OVERPRICED for a 32inch tv"
"for the price, this is a fantastic tv. great color, sound and easy to set up. why pay more? Great TV!"
Great view and sound. Going to buy another soon. Bought one for my room and kids room. Going to buy one for living room to replace my vizio
"I would recommend this product to others because the price is fair, but most importantly it is very user friendly."
Our first smart tv. Super easy. A lot of content. Liked roku so much we got a roku stick fo our old tv.
"I love this updated tv,mine wss from the 90's. Sharp color and easy peasy controls. Finally a good upgrade!"
"Excellent smart TV for the money. Nice image and sound quality, easy to install and works as it should."
"Purchased as I was interested in upgrading to a smart tv for streaming purposes. It has met my expectations, 100%. It is also easy to use."
Works amazingly. Includes all the major media streaming providers and more. Doesn't cost much compared to others on the market.
"my first to tv, love it, great size for a bedroom.  love the fact that it has roku installed so I got all my channels in."
Drove all the way to the store instead of just ordering it on Amazon and now that I have it home there is no remote. Amazing.
"I have had this tv over 1 year it has given me know problems so I got one for my daughter on black Friday.  Great smart tv, I love it!!!"
"I love this tv, great picture, great sound. I love all the options it has. It's a smart smart tv lol. Great buy."
"We bought this TV back in February and it’s great! Clear crisp picture, great screen size. Connects to WiFi like any other smart tv."
Awesome tv for the price. Great picture. The features are easy to use and the remote is pretty fancy.
What can i say its cheap yet works great no problem with setup or wifi picture is great and a smart tv..
Previously bought this model for my daughter. Works and looks great. Now I'm upgrading my son's TV ..
Amazing value for what you're getting. Easy to set up and operate. Clear picture with solid colors. What you'd expect for a 720p screen.
Roku TV works great not sling app Dont waste your money on sling Netflix is working great and other free TV apps work great
"The TV is good, the only problem that I have is the remote configuration. With the volume on the side, it is easy to hit when changing channels."
TCL is a good TV. Decent price. Clear picture. Comes with a lots of apps. Haven't had a problem with it yet.
Bought this for my son's dorm room. Perfect size and easy to set up. Easy access to Netflix and Prime and other streaming apps. Great price!
"Hands down, the best television I have ever bought. I have never been as happy as I am right now because I have this tv."
I bought this TV so I could watch Amazon prime on a big screen. I love the ease of operations and set up. Fabulous picture.
Remote does not have numbers on it.  To punch in the tv channels.  That's what I hate.  Tv is nice otherwise.
Don't waste your money unless you want a tv that's only good for a year. My screen/ picture is totally black and doesn't work anymore.
"I bought one today. It was easy to set up, picture clear, price was right, and now I'm on my way to get another one for a different room."
We have 2-32in and 1-55in and we love ours.  Nothing bad to say.  Have had ours for years with no issues.
This TV has an incredible picture and the sound works very well. The TV was very easy to start up and had no problems at all. Well worth the money.
Best to I had so far audio is perfect and I can even hook up my stereo system up to it and have a blast.
"Geez, a 32 inch Roku smart TV for 150 bucks! Great picture, good sound. Unless you are a complete tech nerd, what’s there not to love?"
The tv started resetting itself and I can't get thw issue resolved I don't have my receipt anymore or the box it came in.
Roku sucks. My remote started acting up 2 weeks after purchase. The roku has trouble connecting often and also eats up data even while turned off.
Super easy to use (even a 5 year old can navigate). Picture quality is great. Great value for a low price!
"Roku does not test their software updates, and doesn't care how they affect customers. I would suggest a non-Roku tv"
"Tv was for nephew and with the apps we were able to program shows for just him.
This was a great birthday idea"
I cant get YouTube on this tv right now but can on others. I tried to watch Newsmax app the other night and it wouldnt launch.
TV is less than a year old. Will not connect to internet even with troubleshooting and resetting etc.
I have not had any problem with this tv at all. This is my first Flatscreen tv and I absolutely love it! I will buy more from them in the future.
terrible tv. had it for 2 months went to turn it on.....wont turn on. Absolutely not worth the money if it only lasts for 2 months.
"I purchased this tv 2 weeks ago!This tv are so easy to set up!Customer service is awesome,patient,and very helpful!Cool
Movies,"
The price in TV was awesome. Setup is easy and fun. Remote is small easy to use. Picture quality is wonderful.
Doesn't last long at all flashing lights on screen and poppy sound I would not buy another one of these at all
"LED lights dont last. Seemed great at first but 1 yr in and the LED went out, screen is black and can't fix it. TCL won't give you the time of day."
It has good quality for the price and mount on the wall great. I'll recommend it's great for the kids room.
Very happy with my new tv. Set-up was easy and picture is great. Large variety of free programs available
Its the perfect bedroom size have one in each kids rooms..I have another one I bought 2 years ago and great t.v. picture sound for such a low price
"The picture is crisp, and the remote is simple and works very well, even at a distance. It seems as though it is a good value for the price."
Have to sign into your personal email for this to work. Also did not see any button for voice search on the remote. I am returning this tv.
Sound has completely stopped working for no reason. In the middle of a show and all of a sudden no sound. Less than 1 week old.. i am furious this seems to be common at Wal-Mart low prices this is what you get. Not happy.
This was very easy to set up! It was well worth the money!
"Bought it for a bedroom tv , ended up in the living room."
brought 4 so far for grandkids games and rv took extended warranty just incase never needed it..
They are pretty much giving these away...Go china!!

This is a great TV. Only had a few months but works well and easy to use.
Good Quality for the money
This TV is ok in the fact that you don’t have to buy a roku
I've been through 4 of these they break too easily.  Will not be purchasing again.
My delivery came on time TV works excellent
great value for the price and has all the apps i was looking for
Wall mount didn’t come with TV.
I have 2 TCL Roku TV'S I'm interested in legs for under the tv can i find the right fit? but i love my tv's best buy for me.
Got for Granddaughter!!!
You have to pay a fee before you even use the tv
the tv is a piece of  crap i bairly hit it with my elbow and the screen shattered
"I deff recommend this item. Took about 1 hour to make I did it alone but it’s simple I don’t know what the rest of the reviews are talking about it’s so simple it shows the pictures of the pieces and number and letters and what they are and step by step. It’s beautiful. I have a 65 inch Samsung smart tv and fits perfect on it, but anything bigger will not fit. It’s lovely"
looks great for the price you pay. it need a little work to put it all together
The instructions were just pictures but it turned out beautiful
"I loved everything about this tv stand. Except the fact it came a little  scratched on the front, by my surround sound speaker covers that part right on up. The blue led light is a bonus. Im 5.2 and I put it together myself in under a hour."
Nice table love the style and the lights makes it perfect
"Super cute, well packaged, arrived early, space saver, and low to the ground.... my only complaint would be that the instructions are ridiculous to follow, as it only shows images rather than written out steps... and the markings for attachments are not very visible... it definitely took an hour or longer to assemble."
"Its a lot smaller than I thought. 
Its not bad at all i like but for the price i was expecting something more bigger and taller thats the reason im giving 3 stars. 
Over all im happy with it i like the design"
"Cheap materials and very difficult to put together. None of the screws aligned. Finally put together after several hours but Im afraid if I move it, it will break into pieces."
"I disliked how the manufacturers were obviously rough with the item during packaging. Had many visible scrapes on my stuff.  Sad face. 
I love this but it's definitely for your bedroom. Got it for my living room and...its just so little. hahaa"
Super disappointed I received the stand and when opened the box the tv stand was broke in half! I really had high expectations for this!
Dont buy this unless you have an engineer to put it together for you. It contains SIX pages of instructions (diagrams only) and the pictures are not clear on what to do! I only uploaded 2 pages. Very disappointed.
Easy assemble love it wished it was bigger as far as height overall
Omg it took me alllllllllllllllllllllll evening and night to get this put together. The instructions are not clear at all. Everything was in the box thank goodness. The shipment was a bit earlier than expected so I was super excited to put it together until... side eyes! Okay product overall. The price isn't worth the trouble and quality.
"Unappealing look and size.  This thing is super small and short. Unless you sit on floor, you wouldn’t like this super short tiny tv stand."
"Too small, very well packaged but not worth it."
Not what i expected does not fit with a 70 inch tv very small. The cost for this is way to high for what you see after assembly the glass does not hold up for the lights this was a total waste of my money and i still dont have a stand for my tv and i have to spend more money
"Pros: Overall good product, looks good, has good finish, small in size for 55 inch tv
Cons: Very hard to assemble, trouble sliding in middle door, side legs do not have proper support so it has trouble moving the table with the tv on top, all back tv wires are visible that makes the experience bad, I feel it is highly priced compared to the quality."
Not comfortable to sleep on but it’s definitely good enough to sit and watch movies. It has a cup holder
"My only issue with it is I wish the led lights was a bit more secure, it keeps either falling off or moving out of it's place. Other than that it looks great"
The LED lights are why I got the item. Its pretty but small. If you're looking for a large TV stand this is not the one. Definitely will take at least 2 people to put it together as the instructions aren't super clear either. Overall its nice. i only paid $100 for it so I expect what I paid for.
"I love the look of this tv console with the blue led lights. it looks very nice, easy to put together. just felt maybe a back brace board would help support it a little more"
"Not worth for money , I received the damage item"
Very cheap wood. Cracks very easily.
The stand looks longer on the pictures than it is in person. Other than that still looks nice.
Not clear instructions for assembling
Poor instructions and the stand looks so cheap.
This entertainment set is really small and kind of hard to put together. There are so many pieces. I would not recommend this product.
"Was hoping it was large like the model (1st) pic, does the job and does look nice.. probably will wnd up ordering a 2nd time to place together to make look larger and cover more space on the wall"
"It was hard to put together but it came out looking nice. After the move, one of the lights stopped working but everything else looks great."
"Absolutely love my new tv stand, it’s very sleek and stylish and complements my living room very well. Very quick deliver with updates whilst it was out for delivery."
I would like to buy for my 65” tv is it big enough
It's exactly like the picture! I like it
Bought this when I moved into my new home. Can hold any size of tv as well as soundbar. Plenty of storage room.
Nice but much smaller than it looked in the photo.  I should have paid better attention to the specs on this.
This is a lovely piece of furniture and looks great in my room. Also quite sturdy and colour is perfect
Not a very big unit but lovely at the same time
"My dad install it for about 3 hours. But at last, it is nice, I love the LED lights."
"Fantastic tv unit, sturdy and looks great"
Looks amazing better than the pictures
"It's not easy to  assemble for me,but I like it"
"Great product, will recommend to friends for sure"
I bought this for my wife.She really likes the extra storage.
Affordable tv unit fits perfectly!
Looks lovely and easy to put together.
The extra storage is nice.Nice TV stand
Love this TV stand. Looks great and very well made.
Cost about 40 minutes to assemble Everything looks great.
"Lovely tv unit, easy to read instructions. Love the gloss affect."
Easy for my husband to put together. Beautiful colour. Everyone compliments.
Liked the style the drawer on the bottom
"Looks great, does the job, everything tidy. Great finish."
"Still waiting to put up, but delivery was quick and delivery men were really helpful."
Looks great in the room just what I needed. Would recommend to everyone.
Looks brilliant. Chuffed with purchase.
Excellent Value for money and a quality product
"Missing part, not a happy buyer!"
"Great quality, fast delivery and excellent value for money. Exactly what I was looking for"
Brilliant quality and quick delivery easy to assemble. Definitely recommend
"Brilliant 
Easy to put together,love the finish result"
"Excellent TV stand, it is exactly what we need!"
Not as high gloss as it looks on pictures but its nice
"I like the black color, LED works fine."
"This product was delivered on time, it definitely worth the price, I love it"
"Nice looking piece of furniture, good value for Money"
Really nice quality and easy to build if there is 2 of you
"Easy to Fit, Beautiful. I like it very much"
I highly recommend it.
"This is the absolute BEST, greatest appliance made for a single mom"
The store was out of this lease expensive Crock Pot.  I'm glad that the Walmart Website had this one in stock.  It's easy to operate and easy to clean.  The black pot also hides the stains better.
"I love the size, but it doesn't come up to temp as quickly as the bigger ones do. Make sure you plan on the longer end of your recipes cook time recommendation."
I love the size for smaller dished and love all black. They only problem is I bought it for a home I don't visit often and I just opened it 3 months later and it has a big dent in the side and I can't fix it. Since I had it shipped 3 months ago and just barely opened I think ive missed the return window. So its only getting 3 stars since Im reporting it so late after I ordered it.
I purchased for my mother. We have used slow cookers for many years. The brand is solid. My issue is the pot was damaged when I removed it from the box. A large scrape was on the lid of the pot. Disappointing but nothing that would compromise the performance.
"I can't believe that someone in the store actually rang this box up and sent out as a sale it looks like someone box up a crockpot getting ready to sale at a garage sale this box came in horrible condition not to mention the tracking had my delivery to be delivered between 2-3 and it di
wasnt delivered until 3:54 with any updates I only had 4 items this was the last straw I'm reducing my shopping at Walmart to minimal and when my year subscription is up I won't be renewing it"
"************ NOT 4 QUARTS ***********
I purchased this for my son to use at college so he could make some of his favorite meals from home that require a 4 quart capacity. This model only holds 3 quarts   one cup and that is to the very top where the lid would rest. What a shame- would be great for smaller recipes though."
"Came damaged (about half of the front right panel had a very big dent), didn't see it until cooking."
recieved with huge dent
I loved it until I noticed a huge dent in the front. Not happy about this at all!!
It  was delivered broken.
"I purchased this for my Dad, who just moved to a small apartment.  His need was for a smaller size to cook meals that he could prepare eat on throughout the week.   He's made several and he loves the ease of all in one cooking.
very happy with our purchase."
"This is my second Crock-Pot and is smaller in size than my original.  My original Crock-Pot is 20 years old and is much larger, now that I'm cooking mainly for myself, I enjoy the smaller size.  It still cooks alot of food, but is easier to handle for clean up and if I want a smaller meal is handles that."
This is a Christmas gift and it sat on my porch in the rain all day today I don’t get home until 6pm I’m not sure if it’s going to work when the person get it.
Love this slow cooker. I use it almost every day.
"I really like the 4 quart size Crockpot size so I bought a second one.  I use for cooking a large side-dish on Sunday’s when my whole family comes to eat after church.  I also have a 7 quart, great for cooking hams or roasts, and 1 quart for veggies/soup for a small number and great for hot dips."
hello Walmart shoppers! I love the fact that I didn't need to go into the store and it was delivered within a few days. my Crock-Pot was exactly as they pictured. I figured I'd saved at least $5 in gas so it really only cost $15 plus no aggravation for having to park I'm going to start having my grocery delivery. thank you Walmart!
"Had my previous crockpot since the early 1980’s so, of course, I brought the same.  BIG mistake not to have read reviews or looked around.  This is NOT the same reliable crockpot I had come to love.  The stoneware is only 1/3 of what it used to be.  As such, it is small for the housing unit and DOES NOT hold the heat.  My beef roast boiled on the low setting.  I spent the day taking the lid off to cool the cooking so I didn’t end up with mush.  :(
What happened Crockpot…CEO need another raise so you HAD to cut back that much on quality?  Shameful!!"
"I bought this to try a recipe for my son. I was happy to know that it turned out well and now I can make other meals. It’s really simple . No assembly turn it on and done. 
One issue I have is that no light came on to indicate if it’s hot and boy it gets hot . I burned my self because I could not tell if it was on so be careful. 
I love it though,"
"I bought one of these about 5 yrs ago, and it had a rubber seal around, and a vent hole in the lid. This one, instead has no seal and no vent, just ridges in the bowl to let steam out. The bowl is lighter too, which I prefer. The knob is rather large, and feels chintzy. This uses about 40 watts on warm, 120 watts on medium and 160 watts on high. Warm is really lukewarm."
I was very pleased with this crock pot. It is small but just the right size for my small kitchen. As I only cook for just me it serves it's purpose. I would recommend this appliance for those who cook just for one or two people.
"I'M GIVING MY CROCK POT 5 STARS..COOKING MY 1ST POT ROAST AND VEGTABLES RIGHT NOW. FIT MY VEGETABLES NICELY AND I PUT MY ROAST ON TOP OF VEGGIES . THE LID FITS PROPERLY. THE HEAT IS HOT ON CROCK POT..IM COOKING THIS ON HIGH..I LOVE IT ..I SO DO..I WAS GETTING BOARD WITH THE SAME OLE SAME OLE AND SAW THIS CROCK POT ON SALE FOR $19.99 AND WENT FOR IT. GOT ALL KINDS OF MEALS ON MY MIND THAT I WANT TO COOK AND BAM MY FOOD IS DONE. THE KITCHEN FEELS NICELY CAUSE THE OVEN ISN'T BEING USED. REALLY LOVE THAT..NO PROBLEMS WITH MY NEW CROCK POT..I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT. GREAT INVESTMENT TO HAVE..I WAS ABLE TO CUT MY ROAST IN HALF AND COOK HALF , FREEZE THE OTHER HALF..GOT A PORK I'M GONNA COOK FOR BBQ. I AM REALLY HAPPY ABOUT MY CROCK POT. WHAT A BLESS..."
"i have  three crockpots of different sizes ,this one has the lid smaller than the pot so no matter what position I put the lid , I will see spaces through , so more electricity waste, more time  cookong , more smell into the house . I was so confident that I threw the box , so I got stuck with this crockpot. iI guess that is what a $20 dollars purchasing power is now at days."
"I’m VERY pleased with my new 4 qt crock pot!! I had the larger one just like it, but left it to a friend when I moved. This one is the perfect size for this single woman, yet is adequate to feed four of me!"
perfect for our small family i love this and feel like its a food size for us im a single mom with one kiddo and this fits our meals perfectly with some left over for later. easy to clean up. heats up fast . 5 out of 5 stars for sure.
"This Crock pot is perfect size for soups and stews. I even cook pinto beans in it to make refried beans. I love the fact that the pot is separate from the heating unit so I can take it out to wash. My other one did not and it was a pain, not being able to submerge it in water. I love my new crock pot."
Crockpot used to be a quality brand name. Now it is a low quality brand name. The crockpot is the only good part of it. The heater part you put it in is very thin and cheap. You can dented easily by pushing it with your finger. Don't expect it to last very long. I have used it once and it worked great and if you are a millennial or younger you are used to cheap thin crap so it shouldn't bother you.
"As others have said in their reviews, this was supposed to be 4 qt, however when I got it home it’s exactly same size as my 3 qt. Same size kid, same size heating unit, same height, same length. Boxing it up and returning it for larger unit."
"I am a third generation crockpot user in our family! I absolutely love the size and easy of functions of the 4 qt pot. I purchased for my RV and couldn't be happier. The liners make cleanup a breeze and everyone loved the smell and taste of my good mornin  Butterscotch Pecan Bread pudding topped with whip and a super easy cheesy  chicken broccoli rice casserole for dinner. It cooked evenly, thoroughly, and so easy to prep and clean on vacation!! Fits perfectly in a small space, love the simple manual switch too!!!!"
"Received 2 of these with defective stoneware crocks. One had a large bulge in the interior crock at one of the oval ends with a line of no enamel. The replacement cane with a dimple in the stoneware crock on the interior bottom with a spot of no enamel. Both crocks are unusable. I bought the Crock-Pot brand thinking I would get higher quality, but I was wrong. I'll have to return the second unit as well and buy another brand."
"I replaced a Crock Pot that was so old I forgot how old with this identical one.  Only difference is it had a stainless steel color, now it's black.  It's very basic: Off, High, Low and Warm settings.  The one replaced was in perfect condition except for the plastic handles on the lid and body; for the price of replacing them I just bought a new one  This size will hold a whole chicken, a perfect size for a couple or small family.  It's a bargain if it lasts half as long as my last one.  Crock Pot--the original slow cooker is the best."
"I absolutely love this CrockPot! I originally had the Pioneer Woman CrockPot and don't get me wrong, I loved it. But this size is much better for us! For reference: we're a family of 5! Deff a great purchase! Would even be awesome as a housewarming gift or wedding gift!"
"Returning it ASAP. Dangerous. Plugged it in to test it before use. When I turned it on and touched the outside, I could literally feel electrical current stinging my hand. My hands %26 surrounding surfaces were completely dry. This is no longer a quality brand."
"The Slow cooker was just perfect for our needs. There are only two or three who usually eat together, so I tend to buy smaller roasts or amounts of meat or chicken. It's just the right size for soups of various kinds which turn out to be cooked just right and remain full of flavor. It's also easier to store when not in use."
make sure you request for a signature when delivered and double check it I received this order it was very nice the other order I did not receive they said they left it at the door don't make much sense when I have a c o d e to get in which they never used so they couldn't have got in the apartment to even leave it at my door which they didn't knock up on I was home all day waiting for them to knock well really to ring my mother so I could let them in my secure apartment building so now I have to pay for my order I did not receive because I want to keep good standings with Walmart cuz they are a good store very pleased with item I did receive I would have my friend shot there but not to get deliveries
"the first 4 qt crock pot was damaged.  i ordered another one with no problem and it was delivered to me in an hour .  with all wrong in the world  you can;t beat walmart  for service and help. They try their best to satisfy all problems and their prices are great. I can't go out much due to health and depend on them for almost everything I need.  They are great to me , thankyou walmart workers"
Do not purchace this item. The outside is extremely hot. I have never had this issue. Would not feel safe leaving it while out and about or around little children. Definitely a hazard!!!
"Cooking in this slow cooker is a breeze.  It has even heat distribution, and is easy to operate.  Also, the price is very reasonable.  I am planning to buy a second one soon!"
just as pictured .. works great ..big enough for my family of 3 ... and doesnt take up much room .. pleased with the price .. happy i bought it over its big brother thats is to big for our needs
The item was sealed but one side of it was crushed … like a can that's been crushed and the item dropped from a plane.  I'm not sure why when it was sealed with foam for protection.   So I will be coming by with it to exchange it later today.
"4 stars because it does not have a timing system. Otherwise very useful. Small, but ideal size for feeding one or two people or 2.5 children. Heats up pretty quickly and high is high. Low is low. So that's good."
"Worked perfectly!  The model I received doesn't have a light that tells you it is on, but you can certainly feel that it is on when it warms up.  Our meal turned out perfectly.  GREAT PRICE!!"
I like the oval shape and the size; it's perfect for preparing a meal for 1 or 6; the price was great too! The store didn't have one in stock and ordering online was easy.
this review is on a seven Court metaphor Court as Walmart sent me the wrong size I've used it once so far so good the only complaint I have is that the inside crock does not fit as tightly as I would like and the lid either other than that it cook my food beautifully
"I made a mistake with the size...4 quart is much too small for soup/stews but will be good for roasts,  chicken  for which I have already used ... did a wonderful job with chicken.."
"Reading all these I think mine must be broken.
Just got up it’s been on all night and not even a bubble.
10 hours it’s been on
An I right in thinking this is the hot setting and the next one is to warm???"
dent in front. it does heat and work well better quality control at manufacturer would help.
I got this to replace my last crockpot after it died and this thing is complete junk compared to my last one. Decent warmer but not good for slow cooking
"Works like any normal crockpot, gets really hot and meat cooked to perfection and tender. So cute and perfect for a meal. Don’t know why there’s complains in this but the price point is awesome for the this little guy."
Has all the settings needed. Works beautifully. Cleans up great. Perfect size for 2-4 people. I couldn’t be more pleased. I definitely recommend it. You won’t be disappointed.
"Not quite the same quality of former crockpot (purchased 12 yrs ago,same brand and shape) took alittle longer to cook than old one. Still a good buy at that price but not expecting it to last more than warranty."
This slow cooker is the same size as the one I used for years. the larger ones are to big and take more space. The price was great but I haven't used it yet.
"The pot isn't as large as I expected, but will work.  I bought it as a gift for one person.  She hasn't commented, however, I own a larger one, and like mine."
"I purchased this 4 quart Crockpot very recently  primarily for cooking dried beans: pintos and great northern especially.  I wanted an alternative to cooking large pots of beans on my electric stove. It would take 3-4 hours and heated my kitchen to where it felt like a sauna, plus the cost of electricity.  I was not disappointed at all and the kitchen stayed much cooler and the cost was under $20.00!!  Its a very basic cooker  and both the low and high settings work well. I pre-soak 2 cups  dried beans overnight and then add them and 7 cups water to the cooker and they are done in about 5 hours on high setting.  Very pleased so far."
"I bought this so I could cook in the summer without heating my apartment up since there's no windows in my kitchen and to replace the small one I've had for over  17 years. First time I made BBQ chicken in it, the chicken was so tender it fell apart.  It's bigger than I thought it would be and cooks great! Well worth the price."
I had been wanting a new Crock-Pot because mine had broken. I did not want to spend a lot so the price was great.  Happy to say this is the perfect size for a family of two. And I have been using this at-least twice a week. It puts ease into my busy schedule. Just set it and forget it.
"I recently purchased this item, I use my Crock-Pot at least three to four times a week and the one I have wore out... after a few uses, I noticed the high and low was not working properly, and the low was rapid boiling whatever I placed in it...not pleased...the whole point of slow cooking, is well....slow.."
I have a 4qt crock pot that chipped and so needed a new one.  this is only a 3qt pot. I measured them both today just to be sure it wasn’t an optical illusion but this crockpot that is advertised as 4 qt is definitely not that size. I will be returning it and finding a true 4qt pot.
i put chicken on at 8 am hoping to have it ready for dumping by by 2 the broth was barely warm.  chicken still raw.
This is a replacement from one I broke only smaller. The smaller size comes in handy and easier to storage!
"very basic.  I have a large crockpot, and a small one.  I needed a medium one. This works just fine!"
I love this crock pot. It's very simple and cooks  my food very well and keeps it warm consistently. No complaints for the price and the quality.
"Tis is a great size for cooking for 1 or 2, dios, etc.  Had a lot of good comments about it at a party."
"If you're single or a couple, this is a good size crock pot for those smaller recipes. I used it to cook a side dish at Easter and it did the job."
"It's a crockpot. It does crockpot things. I don't know what else to say. If you don't know how to use a crockpot, don't get one?"
I feel the crockpot is terrific and there's nothing that I can say bad about it I enjoy using it for cooking and nothing else is better
"Oblong shape makes it easier to place larger foods, especially meats. Simple operation. Does a good job and is decently priced."
The lid doesn’t fit at all. Clearing a quality issue at manufacturer.
Love it. Not sure why I didn’t get one sooner. Super easy for dump meals while cleaning the house. Family loves when I make chicken fajitas in this. Some eat over rice or with flour tortillas
Debated and debated on getting a crockpot. Took a leap of faith and I am so happy I did. This is an awesome product. Perfect size for or family makes dinner easy to prepare.
I don't like that the lid sits oddly.  Another thing that bothers me is that it sits on three rubber buttons. Three makes it tip why not four?
The cooker functions as you would expect a slow cooker to do. I am very happy with the purchase and the price and will recommend it to everyone.
This has 3 feet on the base and it is very unstable! It easily wobbles or tilts and could spill contents while preparing and or serving.
"Bought this in Feb and did not use it till May - however, when I went to use it it did not turn on !!  Does not work!!!  Made very cheap.  Returning."
"Great pot and the perfect size for a couple of people, or 4 people or more, depending on what you're cooking."
started cooking right away. Best chili recipe. Smelled so good in the house. Homemade sloppy Joe next. Perfect size for three with leftovers.
This little crockpot is the absolute perfect size for me. And I love that it has. I keep warm setting.
"It's big enough for what I need, by you should make sure that it will feed your whole family. Definitely does what it's supposed to do."
"Exactly what I expected. 4qt is perfect size for a 3-5lb roast plus carrots, potatos, and stock. Perfect size for 1-3or4 portion cooking(more if youre making something like soup/stew.)"
I love this crock pot.  I had a 6 qt. but it was too big for the 2 of us and this one is a much better size.  I love the removal pot and it is easy to wash.
Love it! Perfect size which is the 4.5 slow cooker. If you have a larger family the next size up would be recommended. Already have used and it's perfect!
This is the right size for small meals.  I use a disposable liner with it and cook small roasts. The roast always turns out perfect and the cleanup is easy.
This was a replacement for one I broke. I can’t function w/o my Crock pot. I used one of the 4 of them at least two or threes a week. I love this one too.
"great buy, first time ive used a slow cooker, now use it weekly and freeze ahead healthy soups, etc, good size for cooking for one if you plan to freeze"
I returned this item because there was a gap between the side and base that would allow food to enter the base. I don’t know how well it works because I did not use it
"cheapest piece of garbage ever.  the last five items ordered were worthless.  while I may continue to use online grocery for basics, not buying anything else there.  returned 3 of 5 products and wish it were all 5."
"Don't throw your money away on this.  It took 2 hours just to heat up but is still not hot. Since it's pork, it's pretty important to get up to the right temperature. Looks like I'll have to put it in my oven after all."
Used it yesterday for the first time to cook soup.  Came home and the floor was all wet from the liquid spitting out from under the lid. The counter was also wet.  Need a refund!
"This small crockpot performs as intended.
The only drawback is the base unit only has 3 legs, positioned at about the 12, 4 and 8 o'clock positions, making it ""tippy"" if pressed on one side handle.
Careful!"
Cheap quality. Outer shell is cheap and flimsy. falling apart after less than 4 months.
It cooked baked beans perfectly.
The only thing that could make this better is some cheap little latches on the sides for the lid
easy to use and cleaning is a breeze to do love this  products!!!
Simple. Small. Works well.
perfect size for 2 people. makes enough for 2 meals.
Quick delivery on a good product.
"Works great, I've used it twice already. I would recommend only filling 3/4 full."
Perfect size. Works way better than my old one.
First time having one and this is great for someone just starting out!
"Nice size, like the oval shape (fits in cabinet easier than round shape) excellent price"
an excellent product. It ls sensation and would recommend it to anyone.
Nothing I like everything
Great size and cooks well
Great price for a great product
"Nice large size, great for roasts"
Nice unit that works well
Good product and quick service
I didn't expect something to be so good for such a cheap price..
I purchased for someone else off of a gift registry- it arrived on time and in good condition
I bought the 2 quart round crockpot and liked it ... so I decided to buy the 4 quart. While it cooks extremely well ... what I don't like is the cheap aluminum knob switch. It's flimsy. I'm cooking more soups and stews and throwing in the freezer so the crockpot is used frequently ... the switch isn't going to hold up.
"It works and produces tender roast ever time 
We use a smaller roast and plenty of room for veggies
Removable crock cleans easily by hand or dishwasher 
I actually have an older model of this as a backup. They’re great and take up much smaller space than standard size"
"This is the perfect slow cooker for a couple or single dude. Easy to use and clean (soak  about 15 minutes for hardened stains otherwise everything is a cinch), convenient (just prep the ingredients, oiled the surface to prevent sticking and select a temperature setting and go!) all for less than $20. For a more authentic cooking, try to saute the aromatics like onions and garlics in oil at high setting with the lid open to sear them and create that smoky flavors.  I work as an essential personnel overseeing important national infrastructure 24/7 and don't have much time for anything else--given the pandemic emergency which exacerbate the need to cook at home-- so healthy eating is a must. The secret is to plan ahead--esp. prepping the ingr..."
"10 months old and the insert has multiple cracks, including one along the entire length of the bottom that leaks.  Never dropped, never dropped anything in it.  I'm surprised it's still in one piece.  It has a 1 year warranty so I'm contacting the manufacturer to see if they'll do anyhthing."
"Just the right size and does the job.  Getting a bigger one would tempt me to make copious amounts of food that would end up uneaten in the freezer forever.  I was really tired of paying $4  for small amounts of hummus in the deli section at the grocers.  This helped me make fresh, organic hummus that filled my Costco-sized hummus container for only $2 worth of dried garbanzo beans.  It will be perfect for our soups and chili also."
It’s great for me. Just the right size and light weight is what I needed. My other Crock-Pot was to heavy and I stopped using it.
"I have only used it once but it worked perfectly.  Good price, fast shipping.  Hopefully it will last a long time."
I received my Crock-Pot in just a few days and was pleased that it was just as described on Walmart. com. It cooks fantastic!
"It works extremely well, especially for dried beans. That's all I've used it for so far, but I am well pleased."
"Love this slow cooker. It’s a great size for cooking for just my partner and I. If you have a bigger family, I would suggest buying a bigger one."
I bought it to keep our food hot for when we’re ready to eat breakfast. Works great! I keep it on warm until we’re all ready to sit down and eat.
Nice product. Works well and is big enough for meals for 2 people but small enough for easy storage when not needed.
Great little crock pot. Perfect for a single person who also has limited space. Can't beat the price.
It arrived damaged
"I made beef pot roast. This slow cooker doesn't have a light to indicate that it is off or on. The dial is had markings to indicate off l, low, high and off. 

Thing is, the line on the dial doesn't point at the right spot when setting the temperature. I changed the setting from low to high midway through cooking and after 2 hours I saw that it had stopped cooking. I toggled the dial again and it set to a spot slightly past the dot. 
Overall I am satisfied but the temperature setting gives me some anxiety. The only way you will know if it is working or not is if the lid is cool and there's condensation under the lid."
"under the inter bowl, metal is damaged"
"just the perfect size for 3-5 people, depending on what you're cooking"
It's perfect for two or a small family
Good size crock pot for small family. Not gigantic like some. The crock comes out for east cleaning
i bought 2 on sale and they work perfect for family or holiday meals
Perfect size…works great.
Small enough for two people yet large enough for a nice sized meal. Works great.
Love that the lid latches.  Great size.
I have used it once.  Works well.
Perfect for cooking for one person.
Does not heat up to what it's supposed to I have box and am returning to store
Perfect size for meals that will feed our family of 5.
This is the perfect size for me!
Perfect size for 1-4 people!
It really doesn't heat up very good
"i  love it , been wanting onefor a long time not disappointed, and a good price."
Its a very nice appliance.  Works well
Just the right size for 1 or 2 people
I love the way it cooks.. It is an amazing product and I would buy again.
"Low settings is really hot, you have to put it on warm for long cooking"
works good and convenient
I haven't used it yet but am going to start preparing my dinner in the morning.
Very lightweight frame. Cooks well.
I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it!
Does the job would definitely recommend l made a cornbeef brisket came out very tender.
awesome little crock pot to make smaller meals.
wanted a smaller crockpot for dips and smaller potluck meals. came in handy just for that.
"I liked the slow cooker, it cooked my meat in s timely manner."
"Loved it , perfect for small get together or for a single or just couple living alon"
"Love ❤️ this crock pot! 
Works great!"
"I use this everyday. 
I actually just made a peach cobbler in it yummy 😋😋😋"
Found just what i wanted online at a super low price.  Works like a charm and the size is perfect.
This product is just right for a tiny space like mine . Cools evenly and is easy to clean!
very easy to use and cleaned up well.
It's a little bigger than i expected but just the right size for me
"I have a larger crockpot, but it’s just too large when cooking for two people and this one is the perfect size for my needs."
"Great gift for the beginner bachelor. not too small, not too big. be sure to include slow cooker liners in the gift package."
I used it right away and was extremely happy with it  It’s great and at a great price. I couldn’t be happier!
"I love the crockpot it’s great for taking dishes to my in-laws, this time of the year. And very easy to clean."
This is a great little crock pot. It works very well and I like the black and silver color. The price is great too!
4 quarts is a manageable size and the oblong  shape fits a small roast or turkey breast without issue
"Basic crockpot that fits my needs. I like the electric that adjust down to warm after the cooking time, but this one works great for taking to work on potluck days. Holds enough and cooks great."
"Everything started out good. Then, in less than a month, it wouldn't wash properly. I thought it was food sticking. Then, it became clear the non-adhesive crock pot itself is disintegrating. This is a health issue."
"This crock pot is great for the price. It's simple to use and the inner crock is removable for cleaning. I bought 2 and will buy more if I need them, they work great for parties."
I have had many crockpots in my life but this one is best I have had. Perfect size and cooked it in time said it would. Easy to clean nothing stuck. Can’t say enough about it
It is perfect for me and my wife we love it. Lets us get out a little more.
Good for family of three.. perfect size
This is the perfect size for what I need and works very well.
I needed multiple crockpots and this item was a perfect choice.
"I love the color of it. This way it don't discolor when cooking something red like sauces, etc."
it's 👌!!  good price  n  just the right size for me. thank you all.
it arrived on time   arrived intact   can't ask for anything more        good job Walmart
Oval works perfectly. Circular too hot on low setting. Oval never fails
"Perfect size, cleans up beautifully.  So very p,eased"
super happy because the store never has the lower price idems in stock
I liked the fair price.  Would have like to have a timer on the pot.
it's perfect 🥰 the perfect size 😍
My dad really liked his gift
"I like the size, sleekness, and the capability"
"on the smaller side of crock pots, but gets the job done! love it!"
Does a great job and price was excellent for one or two persons using it to cook meals.
I love a crockpot. It is so versatile and doesn't need watching.
Got exactly what I ordered and in a timely fashion!
Grest for the price  none stick surface
"Fast shipping, good quality, great packaging, wonderful product!  Highly recommend."
This is a great crock pot was a lot smaller than expected.
this is great for a small family. not big but will do a great job .
Trying to buy this but your app won’t let me.
"Simple, good size, fair price and it worked like a charm"
"Great product, good price and fast delivery."
"grear seevuce, quuck delivery"
"Just what I need for my long work days .I pop my food in either over night or in the morning while at work ,come home its done.I had the bigger one previously and it was my go to."
Perfect size for a family cooks alot of different stuff great quality and easy to use and very easy to take out and clean stores nicely perfect size must have at a great price
Bought this yesterday. Pulled out of box today to start dinner and it’s damaged. The outside of box is not damaged. Just an inconvenience when you live out of town. But other then that I’m sure this product works good
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Since getting this classic 4-quart crockpot cooking has been much easier! This crockpot heats up super fast, has 3 settings, and even has a warmer setting. I absolutely love how my chili cooks in this crockpot. I'd recommend to anyone for any reason or occasion! Seriously, the quality is wonderful."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a crockpot lover and was so happy to add this 4qt crockpot to my kitchen. This is the perfect size for side dishes and desserts for our household but if there are only one or two of you in the home this would be the perfect size for main dishes. Even heating everytime time mean perfectly cooked meal. Easy clean up mean less time at the sink. This will quickly become one of your favorite appliance.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this crock pot! It is just the right size for my soups and chil!It holds a lot ! I am very impressed with this I made my first veggie soup of the season and it warmed up nicely and worked perfectly !I started with low heat and later high heat  and it  switched nicely ,I need three or four more of these ! Lol but seriously love this crockpot!"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This crockpot is perfect for a smaller family,  we are a family of 4 and use it for soups and roast. I love that you can change the settings on it and keep food warm and not overcook it, easy to clean and store away"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Crockpot 4 Quart slow cooker is truly a Godsend when you’re busy with life and want to have a good home cooked meal. It’s simply throw into the pot, switch it on and done.. the color of this model is super awesome: black and chrome which matches all my other appliances perfectly! I love that the serving pot is dishwasher safe, oven safe and we can serve dinner right out of it.. the dish is also deeper than my older crockpot model which helps plenty; means more food for inside. It has 3 settings: low, high and warm. I will share photos down below. So far I love making stews and soups in it. House smells so good during the day while it slowly cooks. This would be a great gift for big familie..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Works for my needs! This is a pretty basic slow cooker with a few manual heat settings. It’s fairly light, which was unexpected, but I take that as a win for easier storage. If you want finer temperature control or other features, upgrade models! For a basic one-pot slow cooker, this gets the job done."
"I needed a new crock. this looked like the one I have been looking for when I received it.  there was a dent on it just like the review said. I though It must have been a one off.  But it is plane to see. this is the same one it has just been passed around to all of us.  I didn't know this was a bad company, that would treat their customers this way. I thought if it was returned it would be thrown away. not recycled. I still need a new Crock, but I will check more   closer to the company before I buy.  As for this one I will take the lost and just throw it away. I don't anyone else to get this piece of junk. So check reviews more closely before you buy."
"DANGEROUS PRODUCT!! The knob on this product is defective! Posing a food poisoning and fire risk! 

Multiple times I have set my temperature to either high, low, or warm, and the black knob with the silver indicator lines rotates, but the actual white turning mechanism/dial behind the knob will go where it's heart desires. THIS IS DANGEROUS. I went to sleep with my roast on low (or so I thought), woke up and while the crockpot knob was still pointing at low, the crockpot was at room temperature, not even warm to the touch!  I popped the knob off to discover the white turning mechanism/dial (that is the functional part of the knob) was all the way in the off position, despite where the plastic black knob was pointing. This caused my roast to..."
Crock pot arrived in good condition and works as it should. It was a great price too.
Too small for us   returning it
Perfect size at a great price!
Smaller size crock pot but very nice for smaller portions
"LOVE my ""NEW"" BLACK FRIDAY SALE 4 quart CROCK POT am so happy.   I can Slow cook Stews"
Website/ordering process easy to use.
"Very nice Crock Pot, especially for the price on sale."
Nice small crock pot good addition to my much larger ones
i only recevied 1 slow cooker not two. please only charge me for one
Love it!  Perfect size for 1 or 2 people.
"great value, works perfectly"
"Great Price!  Super, Fast Shipping!"
It was a gift but he likes it.
so stoked to get this at such a great price. it's a quality product and worked perfectly
I like the crockpot. Just the right size for a family of four.
Awesome quality and price
"It is smaller than what I'm use to, but there are only 2 of us now. So it is great"
purchased one few years ago! buying one for a christmas gift.
"working out great, easy clean, easy recipes come with it."
Works great. Value priced
Product was damaged with a huge dent on the front luckily it worked just fine.
Takes along time on slow cook
it wasn’t exactly what I was needing. I returned it.
Came next day and is great !
Good price works real good I wish it came in red great Buy
Great little crock pot.  I had mine shipped and it came with a huge dent in the base but still seems to work just fine.
"Works great, love the oval design, inexpensive, and all the settings work as they read.  Thank you for the Good Buy."
for $25 in change for a 4 quart crock pot I find amazing use it for the first time the other day my beef stew came out perfect!
"Exhalent size for smaller family I have always used a bigger one now that my family is smaller, I still get to use my crockpot Thanks"
"I have bought this oval slow cooker as a 4 qrt to find out that it holds only 3 qrt. It is oval instead of round, which I like as it is easier to fit a whole chicken in it. It is also simple to use and clean."
"I bought this so I can cook smaller meals next to my bigger crock pot. Well, I just took it out of the box and the lid doesn’t even completely fit. We will see how it works out."
"The size is just right for me and I prefer this shape over my old round crockpot. SO easy to use, just fix and forget. And the price was right! It would be a nice inexpensive gift for newlyweds."
Best little crock pot ever I use to have a fancy one with all the fancy buttons I threw it away this simple one cooks so much better I LOVE IT PRICED RIGHT 10 stars
I have been needing this for a while   It helps me keep my husbands food warm   And makes it easier to focus on his health as I don’t have to worry about cooking
"Perfect size, good price - I don't like all black but couldn't see paying double for stainless/white.  For 1-2 people, small kitchens great size.  Color made it only a 4."
This is a 4 quart which is not as big as some others and is the perfect size for my needs. It is still big enough to cook a whole chicken or a nice size roast. Beautifully crafted. Super easy to clean.
A. You cant beat the price. B. Its a great size for 1-2 people but not more. C. Lighter than it looks. S. Easy to use and clean. Very pleased with this purchase! Makes winter meals in quarantine the best!!
"No complaints. My first crockpot... not as big as I though... had to cut my pot roast in half to fit, but other than that it is great. Got it in about four days."
The best Crockpot for the money. I bought one of these 11 years ago and still worked with the exception that we cracked the bowl.  Best $16 ever spent. They change the quality a little bit however I Definitely recommend
"4 QT is a good size. Gets hot quickly. 3 settings: high, low, warm. Not much different between high and low: still boils. Warm works better than low. Easy to clean. Good value."
Great little crock pot. I had a bigger one that was so heavy and it was hard for me to handle. It is just me and this one is the perfect size. has three settings. Lightweight and I use it regularly.
"I have two large slow cookers but the lid broke to my smaller one so I needed a replacement.  It was round so I like this new oval one which is better for cooking meats that are more oblong in size, like a roast."
"This is a very nice crock pot indeed - a good, in-between size that comfortably handles meals for a small family (3-4 people), and with an unusual design that is eye-catching (a nice, updated twist on the often too-cutesy hearts and flowers motif). Also, price couldn't be beaten. My only problem was the time it took to receive it - just over a week, which in this day and age of Amazon Prime, felt like an eternity. Having said that, after years of being mystified by crock pots,I have recently discovered the benefits (and joys) of slow cooking, and this product has been a very useful addition to my kitchen. Once I master how to adapt cooking times to different types of ingredients, it'll be amazing."
"Recently retired, my husband and I find this crock is just the right size for the two of us empty nesters. We own four Crock-Pots of various sizes that accommodated our growing family through the years...the larger ones retired when I did! This one has become our go-to cooker, great for our soups and stews and for one of our favorite sweets - poached pears! Its oval shape lends itself well to 6 upright pears or a whole chicken or pot roast."
Something is very wrong with this Crock-Pot. It gets incredibly hot. Set it to low with four large chicken breasts and 1.5 bottles of bbq sauce. In three hours the chicken was up to 185 degrees and the sauce was starting to burn.  Second time this has happened. First time I thought it was cheap bbq sauce but kept an eye on it the second time and the exterior of the crockpot will burn your hand. Be careful!
I am recently widowed and getting motivated to cook for myself has been hard.  I needed a smaller crock pot and saw this one. It is so pretty And looks nice on my countertop when I use it. I like to make healthy soups that I can eat for several meals.  This has been perfect.
I love the original crock pot brand and I ordered the with the small one I think I wanted to return this and exchange it for a bigger one with digital but I I absolutely love it I just want a bigger one I know it sounds funny but it's beautiful but I want a bigger one I actually want to buy a few more actually so I'm going to set up for a return thank you so much
"We already owned the 2 quart and 7 quart versions of this product but found that for 2 people many dishes either required something smaller than 7 quarts but larger than 2 quarts. The 4 quart size is great when only cooking for 2 people.  

Crockpots are a great way to cook without needing to attend to the food, and in the summer we leave them going for hours in the garage which helps keep the kitchen cooler than using the stove/oven.

Our dog also lives on a homemade diet and crockpots are a simple way to cook for her without too much effort.  Almost all out cooking needs are now    satisfied with these, the grill, the microwave and an air-fryer/mini oven. The traditional stove top/oven is practically obsolete."
I am presently on a ranch and preparing meals for myself and one other person. Buying this crockpot was a spur-of-the-moment decision but one of the best decisions I ever made. I didn't expect much due to the low price but was I ever surprised. It is a truly outstanding product that performs better than advertised. It has made meal preparation a painless task and the results are consistently tasty. Best buy I made in 2014.
SO FAR SO GOOD WITH THE 4.0-QUART SLOW COOKER. THE FIRST MEAL I COOKED WAS SOUR KRAUT AND SAUSAGE. THE CROCK COOKER COOKED THE MEAL EXTREMELY EFFICIANT. THE SLOW COOKER GOT HOT VERY FAST AND THE MEAL WAS DONE BEFOREB I KNEW IT. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PIECE OF COOKWAREE
"I bought a small Hamilton Beach 2.5 (3qt) Crockpot in 2005 and it still works.  But lately I wanted one slightly bigger and bought this 4qt so I can cook a pork roast steak and small chicken at the same time.  The reason for changing the brand was price mostly and Walmart's wonderful guarantee should I have a problem.

It works beautifully and both were scrumptious, cooked on High for 4 hours together.  I use a packet of pepper gravy mix in my liquid."
"I purchased this product about a month ago (I had ordered it before arriving in CA, then I was off on another trip). I finally used it last night. I am totally pleased with the product. It's the perfect size for my husband and me (we are seniors), as we are not big eaters. I prepared a small loin roast with a couple of veggies, and still have enough for 2 more meals. Next up? Lamb stew!!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this and when I received it I noticed I had bought the small one.  I guess I didn’t pay any attention to size I just wanted one like my old one in that red color.  I returned it today.  You do not make that one in that red in a 6 qt.  I really want one in that red. I’m disappointed.
"First time using a crock pot that has separating crock which is a breeze to clean. This 4qt is a perfect size for meals for 2-4 people. Makes it easier to store as well.
Need to try more recipes to get the most out of the convenience of a ready made meal within a few hrs!"
Works great and just the right size for a full meal for 2
did not receive. not sure probably a great product
it's just the size and shape I wanted. reasonable price
Convenient and great for smaller family
"small dent in the front...I want a partial refund, or replacement..."
Perfect for 2 people!  Love it!
It is the perfect size for me.
I purchased one of these and it looks like it got beat with a baseball bat
"what a piece of poo, we were moving and i packed my big expensive ninjas and ended up in an empty house for another week so i ordered a small crockpot because crockpot has always been reliable right... this one musta missed that memo. 1 hr on high temp i was able to stick my hands on the aluminum cookpart and was only warm enuf to keep my hands warm. omg ridiculous. if i wanted small amt of my food 32 hrs later im sure it be okay. me sitting on it and cooking it may work better. all i have to say is wow. dont buy."
Up to the fill line this holds exactly 3.125 quarts. That's almost an entire quart less than four! I called Crock-Pot customer service and they said it's normal to actually hold 1 qt less! Unbelievable but true! The customer service rep had extreme difficulty with English and I had to repeat myself four different times.They could not provide an answer as to why the discrepancy between reality and advertising. Completely useless customer service and a crock pot that is not what it represents itself to be. I wish I could give this negative stars. The Crock-Pot company should be ashamed of itself. False advertising and lousy customer service.
"I love it. My 1st meal was a pot roast with potatoes, other veggie. It turned out fantastic. The price was great"
"Great size crock pot for two people. I have a 7 quart like this one, but I think this 4 quart will better for us."
This crockpot only had three legs. I think I would like it if I could use it. Please advise it and exchange it
"Perfect with covid-19 lock down, works well,  best part it's done overnight, easy to use, easy to clean it's a winner! Love it. No one can beat that price."
I bought this to replace a 20 year old 3 qt. Crock-Pot which is still working which we thought that it might wear out and this was a great price. Have used it once so far and performs perfect. This makes our Seventh rock-pot and we use them all.
"This replaced one like it (except white) which worked for many years. Finally quit, and to try and fix it, you need to destroy the outer case. Wish it came in other colors."
"Disappointed with the cookbook. Needs some sort of table of contents to find what's wanted. For example, page numbers under headings such as chicken, beef, seafood, vegetarian, dessert."
I am so happy with this smaller size crock pot.  It's a win-win!  I wish WalMart was more consistent with delivering items that I order instead of telling me they are processing these products for me to pick up!!!
Love this 4 Quart Original Crock Pot. Perfect size for this elderly lady. I can put in my ingredients in the morning and I got dinner in the early evening.
"Purchased to replace a 2 1/2 qt. round slow cooker that was more than 20 years old. Liked the fact that it was oval shaped and my favorite color, red!"
Love this.  I have a really large crock pot and there are only 3 of us at home now.  This 4 quart is the perfect size for a meal with plenty left over for another day.  After 7 months of use it is just like new.
I absolutely love this slow cooker. It works awesome and prepares the best home cooked meals. One thing that I like is that it really doesn't take very long despite being a slow cooker.
"I love this crockpot! Made beef stew in it yesterday and it turned out perfectly. The heat settings are great, low isn't too hot and high isn't burning anything. Great bang for the buck!"
"A basic slow cooker that does what a slow cooker should do, it does it well and is very attractive.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles (like a timer) of more expensive slow cookers, but I don't need the fancy stuff.  For $20, it's a winner!"
"The only thing that is disappointing to me is the weight of the crock itself. Even as a 4-quart it is difficult for me to lift. Otherwise, it cooked well and I love the color and price of this item."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great crockpot.  Perfect for dinner for 2.  Used with liners for easy cleanup.  I have a few different sizes crock pots and I use them all.
"very cheap but the real issue is it's almost impossible to get the crock out of the unit. It literally takes two people to pull it apart and even then it's quite a wrestling match. By then I just want to toss it.
very unsatisfied"
Great slow cooker at a great price!  Not too large nor too small.  Just perfect size for me.  Small is just too small but this size is perfect.  Works great!  Love it!
"I purchased the crock-pot about 6 weeks ago.
Wonderful for travel and cooks very reliably.
Renting a house for 2 months and it helps cooking in many ways. One super pot."
I had problems with the digital Crock and wanted to go back to the manual model.  Glad I did and the all black style is just what I was looking for.  So far this one is outstanding.
Bought my red crock pot about 2 weeks ago & have already used it several times.  I love it. Makes cooking during these hot summer days so easy....& allows the house to stay cool yet we can still have a great hot meal!!!
This is just the right size for my husband and myself.  Plenty of room for a good size roast and doesn't take of too much storage space.  This is my go to slow cooker when cooking just for us.
"I own a 7 qt. and a 2 qt. Crock-Pot. I kept getting recipes for Slow Cooker desserts, and they mostly call for 4-4.5 qt. cookers. The price was certainly good, so I decided to order one. I made several desserts with this cooker, and I love it!!"
"We have used it at least once a week since it arrived. This is the third Crock Pot we now own. We use our pots all the time. I like that is is smaller and has the ""warm"" setting."
I enjoy both the very large and this one the moderate sized crock-pot. I can fix wonderful meals that do not require the use of cooking oils thus reducing the fat and calories without loosing any of the flavors of the foods. It is truly versatile.
After having to return two larger croc pots that were both faulty I finally was able to find the proper shape and size I needed and it's working great.
Nice little pot for the price . I would give it a 5 star but I not crazy for color. I wish they would make more white pots in oval. Don't like blacks & dark colors ..that's just me.
"Love this in red. I also bought liners for easy clean up, but even when I forget to use them, clean up is pretty easy. So nice to put dinner on in the morning and have it done when I get home. I can even cook beets in it, so I have fresh food"
I love the Crockpot.  It was a replacement for one I had for 20 years.  The new one is perfect.  The shipping time was fast.  The price was just perfect.
"i got this in less time than was stated! It's perfect for someone like me who lives alone and isn't into cooking all the time, was perfect on first use, and will get a lot of ""miles"" out of it. Thank you!"
I'm not sure how it cooks - remains to be seen... but it's been on for 25 minutes and I went to move it a bit on my counter and literally burned my hand on the metal that surrounds the top of the pan! It sizzles like an iron you're testing for readiness. VERY concerning...a child would definitely be burned... I WAS.
"clear instructions say 5th Wheel but put on the porch of my home, I live in my 5th Wheel! It's aggravating because I have to wait for my husband or brother in law to go get it and bring it to me since I am on oxygen. My door was open the whole time but I can't get out the door to yell!"
came out of box with dent
"It's a good crockpot for my mom, who makes small meals, but unfortunately the control knob fell off and I can't find a replacement for it. If anyone knows where I can get a knob please let me know"
its simple but sturdy. i used it immediately to make a roast and the meat was moist and delicious.  i didn't have a lot to spend but you can't go wrong with the name. more than worth the money.
"Why on earth would Crock Pot make an oval - or any other shape - crock pot with three legs?  I unpacked the one I just bought and thought it was broke.  It tips easily to one side with pressure, not to say it tips over but wow."
"I love this little helper!  it has 3 temperatures, low, high amd warm.  and the size is perfect for a hungry family of 4.  The possibilities are endless, from  pork with latino spices to a spectacular meat loaf with wine, balsamic oil and cilantro... just a very good and cheap appliance that is gonna make your life easier and happier.  Buy it if you have the chance"
Worked perfectly for camping. Popped the food in and it cooked while we did our other activities for the day. Only down side is that it seemed to take a bit longer than normal for a roast but I did have it cooking outdoors vs. Indoors so maybe that contributed (?). Overall very good for keeping sloppy joes and taco meat warm.
Perfect size for someone living alone and the best price on the internet!!
Did not come with the glass top
I bought this to replace one the same size but digital. I like this one better.
"Not a large pot , but good size for small family of 3"
The crock pot was a Christmas present which was well received.
Really liked this crockpot. Right size and color for a single person . I would buy it again.
I tend to buy one every couple years - I live in a complex with no kitchens
It arrived damaged. I need to return.
"Bought one because my friend gave me one of hers. Not disappointed!!!
Great product and so affordable."
"I love this 4-quart slow cooker.  There's only my husband and I to cook for
and the other crockpot is too big.  It's easy to clean."
"Prompt delivery.  The size is larger than the old crockpot replaced, but I do not have a problem with that. Easy to use and to clean."
I got this for my mom as a bday and Mother’s Day gift. She has yet to open it but I love the one I own so I highly recommend it
"Bought for my son who loves corned beef and cabbage, so now he can make it for himself any time he wants!"
Replaced an old Crock-Pot with the same model.  Works great and some minor improvements in newer model
"Use for spaghetti sauce , perfect size! I had donated my large crock pots but this size is by far my favorite!"
Works just as my old one did and so much better than the fancy expensive programmable waste of money “upgrade” I thought would be better!
"This is my seven pot, all different sizes for special uses.  I really like this size pot and plan another as a gift."
"After burning myself on the outside and the lip where the crock sits in, I sent it back. Very unhappy."
Love the oval shape.  Cooking bags fit in this one better.  I had a 2 qt and so small had too much bag to get food out of.
Perfect size for small family and its oblong shape fits well on upper shelf of lower cabinets. Removable ceramic dish makes clean-up very easy.
Haven't used this yet as it's a gift for Christmas but the product arrived quickly. It's a great size for a small family and the design is beautiful.
I purchased this as a housewarming gift as the recipient had stated they needed one...no response as to if it was liked or not.
"Love this size.  I have used one like it for years, but the pot finally cracked. So happy to have a new one!"
"Great for cooking meat while working, then dinner is easy to prepare.  Also great for making desserts."
"I bought this cooker because of size, price, and flashy color. It has been used once and it is perfect."
Excellent Crock-Pot for an excellent Price! This has worked very well for my family of two and having over a guest or two.
"Normally I like the Crockpot brand, and I am sure it works fine.  This one was cracked when I took it out of the box."
very beautiful and nice alow cooker it cane really fast. wasn't expecting it until weekend but its finally here thanks Walmart
love it. Used to make a side dish and it was still a little big. Needed something smaller than our 7qt crock-pot. Great for a small family.
Love this. Wasnt expensive. It serves 4 people but I bought for my son and I and is perfect size for chili.
I have the red color. It's perfect for 2-4 people and the right size to leave out on the counter. Plus it's easy to clean.
I have one already I bought this one this time for my mother-in-law. And I have mine for five years already and I love it
"This crockpot is perfect for 2-5 people. It isn't too big, has two temperature settings and a warming option. Love the look. I couldn't be happier."
Great for cocktails and small meals.  Cooks well and very attractive.  Goes with the decor in my kitchen.
"Perfect size  for me and works great. It's basic, nothing fancy but it is just what I wanted . Will buy again."
"Perfect for what I needed, I use this at least once a week, Perfect size, I have a very small counter space"
Glad to be able to get a crock pot like this; I do not care for the new fast cookers. I would have liked another color other than black.
"This is one big crock of crap. Temp knob doesn't work right, and never gets hot enough on high setting. I'll buy another brand from another store."
This pot is made with 3 legs instead of 4.   Obviously very very flimsy and unstable.   Cheap thin glass and plastics.
I got my mom one of these as an early Mothers Day gift and she LOVES it. So easy to use and so stylish.
I absolutely love this crock-pot. We had a larger one still do the smaller one is great for when we go and stay in airbnbs or even a hotel room
WalMart may send you a recycled and damaged product like this one. Product had been put in original box that was damaged and shipped to me. Evident it was a return by someone else. The Walmart box they shipped it to me in was undamaged. Not good!
This crockpot arrived obviously used. They didn't even have s ense enough to clean it before reboxing it. I am very dissatisfied and would like someone to come pick it up and bring me a new one.  I did not order from Goodwill.
I've used it twice and so far I like it its a perfect size for what I wanted and it works  great
Good price and good product
I love this!!! Use it at least three days per week. Works perfectly. Buy this.
"Its a good size for me, there's only 2 of us so my bigger pot was just to big."
"Size, simplicity, and savings."

I love this product would love to give to someone.
I have a smaller and larger one and just needed a mid size
perfect for two people that don't eat alot and cooking wonderfully
Delivery was unacceptable. Box was in pieces
Works great - but don't you expect that for any crock pot? How complicated can it be?
"Great crockpot, perfect size."
"I ordered this to try a crockpot sourdough recipe, perfect size!!"
great crockpot unlike the bigger size and digital dials I had.
awesome crockpot.  just want I needed
Perfect size......I hope it lasts longer then my last crock pot
Perfect size! Used it the day I got it! Been using it several times a week!!
The women at the return counter were professional and fast.
"Great Buy, and size for small family, cooks potatoes perfectly for Sunday Chili"
Exactly what I wanted. Perfect size for my small kitchen.
Couldn't believe low price.  This is the same Crock Pot  a family paid $20.00 more.
Perfect size....heats evenly.... Meat came out tender
I love the size of this 4Qt slow cooker! Great size and not bulky!
Disappointed that the knob fell off after the first use.
"It is what I ordered , it came on time and meets  my needs"
Works grate nice to have in my kitchen
This crockpot gets the job done. It is very functional and inexpensive.
Good size for meals for 2 or 3 people.
I really like it. Just what I wanted.
Just the size for my needs
works well good size i had a much bigger one but as family got smaller this is easier to handle
I used it right away. I live in Mexico and this is something that saves me time
"Love! Made 4 meals already, came out perfection each time!"

GREAT !!!"
My brother lived in a small space with no cooking stove. Help him cook meals like he had a stove.
"Love it, have used it a few times, cleans easily,"
"It's a gift, and she loves it."
Okay but I expected to be larger
Worked great...wish it had a light to indicate that it's on or off.
Only returned because I was given one by a friend.
LOVE IT. JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO MEALS FOR TWO PEOPLE.
This crockpot is the perfect size for the two of us! It works well too.
Great size for 2-3 people............Love the design
Not bad for the price does just what it's supposed to do I just wish you had a timer
"Don't like the oval shape, it cooks differently"
Just right for two ppl to have leftovers!
This was purchased as a gift I cannot comment on this specific purchase.
"Great price with free shipping, can't beat that."
I like it because the prices was right. I love cooking with the crockpot. Go get one.
Works great and simple to use
Nice size for 1 or 2 people nice price
Small. Works fairly well.
works well for two people
Perfect size for one or two people to use on the daily
I like the size and color (red). Easy to clean. Makes cooking easy.
I liked that it was big enough and not too big
"So far works great,,,,good price!"
I should have gotten a 6qt. Instead. Still a little small for 3 people.
Wish I would have purchased 5 or 6 quart....4 at is just a bit small.
works great very light weight
It is just the perfect size I needed as a second crockpot
I needed a smaller pot and this fits the bill.
This crock pot really cooks food evenly
13.50  free shipping  at store 9.00 good product
I love my new crock pot. I works really good.
Overall it's a good crock pot. I like how good it cooks
Very nice Works fantastic
"I already have this 4 qt crockpot (for about 2 years now) and it works great. I purchased this for my son (out on his own now) who just started experimenting with cooking in a crockpot. He says the 4 qt is the perfect size. He has only had it for about 2!weeks and it has been his fo to appliance. He has cooked bbq, chicken, taco soup and says it the right size for a single man and have left overs to carry for lunch next day. However, he agrees with me that the power cord needs to be longer."
Poorly made. Mine came damaged. Had to return. Overall the look is nice but not sure about the quality.
Nice product but not 4 quarts. Holds just slightly over 3 quarts. I measured it with water before using. So I’m returning it.
"Very nice delivery. Polite %26 made sure he was leaving it at right place. The product is to replace one we broke, but used a lot and loved."
It is ok. Doesn't get very hot. I returned the wrong one.
Works perfectly. Easy to clean
crock pot/slow cooker 40 quart
"I real love the crockpot, this is my first one I ever own."
This was the perfect size for a smaller meal.
You would not believe how much smaller the 4 quarts are. If you want a 4 quart you better buy an 8 quart.
"Big enough for 2lbs hamburger, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can hatch chilis, 12oz beer, Chopped onion, 3 jalapeno and spices.
Works just fine."
I love the size of this crockpot. It’s the same size as my old one that was round. Heats very evenly and works great.
i ordered and did not receive my crock pot and was still charged i have never had this issue with my orders extremely disappointed
Love the way it tenderizes even the toughest cuts of meat.    I wish the outside pot didn't get so hot.
Slow cooker is damaged.Dent on front of cooker.
This is such a great price
slow cooker is all dented up.
Lovin be it use it at least 2twice a week
I purchased one at walmart box in good shape opened up and had leftover food on base and base dirty buy something new get something used no way do business
"I was actually excited by the ""IMPRESSION"" I had about this perfect sized little crock pot.  However, I gotta say, disappointment began setting in when I lifted the lid from out of the box.  True to my instincts, the lid is disproportionate  to the stoneware.  Very poor quality.  The lid is not weighted enough for this pot.  Nor is it shaped to fit.  I gave it a try regardless and my guess is that the temerature  settings are off as well.  So DISAPPOINTED.  Very poor quality  control (if there is any).  Will not even consider buying this brand again.  Boo-hoo!"
"I purchased what I thougt was a 4 quart crock pot.  The box was clearly marked 4 Quart.  I did not need it for several months.  When I needed it, I found that it only held 3 quarts to the brim.  I had not saved my receipt and only know that I bought it either in Eastland or Abilene Texas.  I tried to get help from crock pot to no avail.  I know that the one I bought is not the only one mispackaged.  I need a 4 quart.  Do I need to take it out of the box in the store and measure the capacity?   The crock pot works fine, just can't use it for purpose purchased."
"Item box damaged, opened and big dent in crockpot. Think Walmart shipped it that way cause nothing else I ordered in box was damaged. Shipping box was fine.  Very dissapointed because I could not use product and now have the hassle of doing a return\n"
"I own a few slow cookers from various manufacturers and wanted a 4 quart model.  I’ve never had a problem with any of them. In fact I just scrapped my 1976 model because I couldn’t get a replacement for the original plastic lid that had cracked. That was a CrockPot brand. I’ve used this model 5 times carefully following recipes I’ve used before. Each time the food was burned, contacted crockpot customer care through their website. Tried twice, got error message both times. Decided to try calling instead. Then I got 2 emails and 2 case numbers. One wanted me to preform tests of the product to prove it wasn’t working properly. The other email wanted info like date of purchase, manufacturer code, etc. I replied with info. Then I got an email f..."
I didn't expect something so tiny. This crock pot is way smaller than it looks in the pictures.
"I love it, I literally ordered at 12pm and got it at 7pm 🤯 amazing products"
too small for household size. will need to purchase bigger one
"Had some scratches. Looks like it may have been dropped. Said on the box, made in China. I was under the impression that the Crockpot Brand was made in the US. It was returned. Will look for a different brand."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was pleasantly surprised at how well this performed. Looking at the price, I wasn't sure it would do as well as my more expensive, flashier slow cooker with its plethora of features. But it exceeded my expectations. It's basic, yes, but it looks pretty sleek on my countertop and is perfect for smaller sides. I would definitely purchase this as a gift for someone."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall, I am very happy with the product. It heats up quickly and I was particularly impressed with how quickly it cooled off. I did have to use the high temperature instead of low on a couple of recipes, but I am not sure if that was due to the amount I was cooking or the Crock-Pot. My only concern is the lid. while beautiful, it seems very delicate."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Crockpot 4 Quart slow cooker is great. It is a good size. I like that you can choose between 3 heat settings. I have made many meals in this crockpot. This is really convenient for me. This crockpot is easy to use and clean. Great product to have.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the 4-Quart Classic Slow Cooker in black color and it was so easy to use. You do not need to add water just plug it in and adjust to your warm or hot settings then after a while it will start getting hot after all this is a slow cooker! I love it, works great!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The product is extremely easy to clean. Tough stains wipe away easily. It is light weight compared to others I have used. It is easy to store. Cooks food to protection. The price can't be beat especially for such great quality.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This crockpot is the perfect size for my daughter and I.  After cooking soups,  chicken and  rotel and cheese we had just enough for leftovers. With fall coming,  cant wait for gatherings for chili!  This appliance is the perfect addition to any kitchen."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Received a Classic Crock pot in red as a gift. We have used it for many years and loved everyday with it. Yesterday was its last day. Leaked on the counter and could not go any longer. We have ordered a new one already. Quality product for reasonable price.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this size crockpot. It is just right for a small family. It cooks everything evenly and works really well. I have made a few delicious recipes in this crockpot with no issues. I let things cook all day and everything is cooked just right. I would definitely recommend this product to others! It works great!
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a great crock pot. Since having it, I have cooked a roast and soup and both cooked perfectly.  I like that it has a warm feature. I also like that it’s very simple to operate. It’s not digital with timers or features I find unnecessary. Very easy to clean as well. This size of 4 quarts works out perfectly for a family of 2 or larger."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recieved this crock as a gift and used it today for the first time. I filled between 1/2 - 3/4 full with chicken, soup, and veggies. I set it on low and left for the day. When I returned 7 hours later, the pot was boiling and the chicken had turned to a mealy mush. My dinner was ruined! What's the point of setting this to cook all day while I'm away if when I return my food is overcooked?"
"We filled the pot with liquid, veggies, curry sauce, shrimp, and coconut milk to make my wife's prized Thai Curry Coconut soup. She turned it ""warm"" to hold for two hours before the gathering, and it was boiling after an hour. If it's going to boil on ""warm"", how are we supposed to keep food warm without over cooking?"
This is a very nice product my grandchildren insist on taking one home with him every time they come to eat I have bought several I need a I need one more between my grandchildren and my daughter they leave me empty handed great item they love it I loveit
"I have to agree with the rest of the comments in this regard. I have been thinking for the past two years since I owned this particular slow cooker that perhaps mine was defective. So I came on here to read some reviews. It looks like others share the same problem (frustration) with this particular model.
This ""slow"" cooker does NOT cook slow. Not even on LOW. It boils food. I cannot set a meal to cook on low before going to work in the morning because when I come home after 8-9 hours, my food is basically cooked to death/mush. Seriously. The recipes that say ""Set to High for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours"" do not apply to cooking in this Crock-Pot. Even on a low setting, it will be done in 4 hours. This appliance does not meet the needs of a ..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Crockpot 4-Quart Classic Slow Cooker is just the perfect size for my family of 4. It has a very basic and user friendly manual knob with settings for low, high and warm. The Crockpot Slow Cooker is a very stylish black and chrome which looks great on my counter top. The stoneware crock can also be put in the oven to crisp up your food after cooking, up to 400 degrees. I've made chicken, soups, stews, roasts, chili, cranberries and beans in it so far and everything has up cooked perfectly. You can put your food on in the morning and by the evening dinner is ready. 
It is a nice size which makes it easier to store. The removable stoneware and lid are Dishwasher-safe. I definitely recom..."
"This was the third (yes, THIRD!) crockpot we tried buying from our local walmart today! The first one had a gouge in the crock. Very dangerous as this can leak lead into your food. The second was obviously used previously as it hadn't been cleaned well. There were wipe marks and you could see the remnants of food on the walls of the crock. This one (yes, the THIRD purchase today!) has only three legs! Yep, you read that right. Something intended to hold extremely hot, boiling food was designed with ONLY THREE LEGS and is unsteady / easily unbalanced! Who in the heck decided that!!! If that isn't asking for someone to eventually get horribly burned...!!! I think I'm done shopping for crock pots at Walmart for now!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a great crock pot.  It is a nice size for my family of 4.  Its perfect for making dips for party's and meals that aren't huge.  I also have a large one that I use for big roasts or big batches for leftovers or freezing but this is perfect for smaller meals or less people.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love my crock pot slow cooker ir is perfect just put the Ingredients in it put the lid on and set your temp and let it go! I put a roast in and along with potatoes and all when I get up in the morning set it to medium and by 5 or 6 in the evening it's ready to go! The best thing about it is you can cook so many different things in it like chili soups pretty much anything!  Great  especially in the fall I can make so many warm hearty meals in my crockpot slow cooker it is such a handy little thing to have around!
"I had a 4 qt. crock pot ( brand name) since 1992. ( 30 years old!!!) I loved it and cooked tons of meals in it. It just got too old. The cord was damaged and the inside was not shiny and would get stains, so I just threw it away. I ordered this one from Walmart recently. Somehow I got part of my order( an electric skillet) but not the crock pot. I chatted with a rep who told me something went wrong with the order and to reorder. I decided to reorder somewhere else. I found a package on my doorstep today from Walmart and it was the crock pot. It was in a huge box. It was in its box also, but with extra tape. I don't believe it was damaged in transit. When I got it out, it had a 4 inch gouged out scratch on the front. Not too cute! I will hav..."
"2 things, 
1st the crock does not fit snugly enough, will slide around in the heating part.
2nd the screw that holds the knob on the lid is short and aluminum, allowed the lid knob to come loose and spin, when you go to snug it up the screw just spins, removed it and fond the threads on the aluminum screw were flattened/stripped. 
and could not be snugged up.
and of course you can't get a new knob and screw from the manufacturer, you have to buy the whole lid costing 2/3s of the price of the crock pot. 
too late to return it, will have to look for replacement knob and screw for lid. 
found a 2 knob and screw set that will work on amazon for $6.

screw should have been stainless steel..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently got this and I absolutely love it. I love being able to come in the door, throw a few things in the crock pot, do a few things around the house, and then. Supper is ready with little effort. After a hard days work this is so easy and great."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This smaller crock pot is perfect for small cooking jobs, like dips or when I’m only cooking for two. I have the larger 6.5 qt crock pot as well and it’s great for roasts or bigger items, but I like how compact and easy to clean this one is. This is great tool to have in the kitchen, I’ve never burnt anything in this crock pot! This would make a great wedding present or house warming gift. I would definitely recommend the purchase."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] THIS IS A LIGHTWEIGHT, EASY TO USE SLOW COOKER THAT SHOULD BE A STAPLE IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD!  THE USER MANUAL WAS EASY TO READ WITH BASIC INSTRUCTIONS AND RECIPES.  I WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE RECIPES, THOUGH. IT COOKED THE FOOD EVENLY AND THOROUGHLY.  CLEAN UP WAS EASY WITH NO FOOD STICKING TO THE BOTTOM.  ONE ISSUE I DID HAVE WAS THE SCREW ON THE HANDLE OF THE LID CAME LOOSE ON THE FIRST USE.  OVERALL, I WAS HAPPY WITH THIS SLOW COOKER FROM START TO FINISH!"
"Just cooked a 2lb Black Angus chuck roast, seared, topped with celery, onion, garlic, baby carrots, whole red potatoes, broth, seasoning.   Cooked on high for 4 hours.  Meat just fell apart, delicious.  Nice compact size (which can be tricky to find) great for just us 2 but you could get 4 portions out of it. No fuss dial, easy to store.  For the price I am very happy."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a single mom of a one year old boy so I am very busy but want to feed my son a healthy dinner so I turn to Crockpot regularly. This was the perfect size for our little family and we even have leftovers when we use this. I love to use it year round, whether it be for hot cocoa, bbq chicken, stew or even baked potatoes.. it cooks everything perfectly without really having to do much. I would recommend this to anyone!"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This crockpot is the perfect size for 2 to 3 people. It is very simple to use, simply put in everything you want to cook and turn the dial. I like to put my ingredients in the night before and then the next morning I switch it to keep warm and I have hot meals the whole day. Everything has worked great with this product, just as expected."
"I go this because I sometimes wanted to make a smaller portion and did not necessarily want to use my older large crockpot. Yes the older one is made better, yes it is a lot more sturdy but this one does the job. As with most ""newer"" things I am sure it will not last 15years like this older one has (it was my grandmother's before) but for now it is good enough."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this crockpot! I have made a few dinners in it already and it has made the cooking process so much easier for me! It’s great for making stew. You can cook on low, high or keep it on warm. Clean up for it was pretty simple too."
We had a crock pot for a long time and it went out and I love my crockpot. I hope this one lasts as long as the other. I use about once a month for pot roast or beef stew. I also love throwing chicken in for pulled bbq chicken. Easy to clean and store. Great size.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My wife and I received this model as a wedding gift two years ago. Crock Pot cooks too hot for temperature settings on device, so much so that while cooking on a ""low"" temperature recipe, the insert dish cracked all the way down the side rendering our slow cooker useless. We have use the ""Crock Pot"" brand in the past but this model was a big let down since it still carries the ""Crock Pot"" name."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Crock-Pot - The Original Slow Cooker - Black in Color. This Slow Cooker does what it sets out to do: slowly cooks your meal while you are busy doing something else like working, cleaning the house, sleeping, etc. It’s a 4-Quart Cooker which is just the right size for my family. I’ve had slow cookers in the past that were way too big and bulky which makes storage awkward, especially when you don’t have much of it! All you have to do with this cooker is set your meal on High, Low, or Warm with the one dial on the pot. I love that simplicity because when I travel out of town to visit my Mom, it’s super simple for both my husband and/or son to operate. I can leave them a recipe with just a few..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] THE CROCKPOT ORIGINAL SLOW COOKER IS LIGHTWEIGHT WITH BASICALLY NO ASSEMBLY REQUIRED.  THE USER MANUAL WAS EASY TO READ WITH BASIC INSTRUCTIONS AND RECIPES.  I WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE RECIPES, THOUGH.  IT COOKED THE FOOD EVENLY AND THOROUGHLY. CLEAN UP WAS EASY.  FOOD DID NOT STICK ON THE BOTTOM. ONE ISSUE I HAD WAS WITH THE SCREW ON THE HANDLE ON THE LID CAME LOOSE ON THE 1ST USE. OVERALL, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SLOW COOKER TO EVERYONE. IT'S A TIME SAVER AND MAKES YOUR HOUSE SMELL GREAT!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like to slow cook dinners a few times per month.  Usually I hate the cleanup because I have a very large crockpot that is super heavy and hard to clean.  I literally have to wait for my hubby to clean it because its so heavy.  This new 4 qt. Crockpot has a light weight crock that is removable and very easy to clean even for me!  It is large enough that I cooked an 8lb turkey breast roast in and it fit with plenty of room.  Came out beautiful and moist.  The controls are simple.  I've cooked a few roasts so far ...one on high and one on low setting... both came out great.  My old huge crockpot is probably going to collect dust now that I have this simple smaller one.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so happy with my 4 qt. Slow cooker. I got black. I really like the oval shape this one has. Has the classic warm low and high. Nice heavy ceramic insert thats easy to take in and out for cleaning. Definitely a great addition to my baking.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good Evening Reviewers!! I just wanted to let you know that any home with a working kitchen needs to always have the amazing classic Crockpot!! I really love how solid the inside pot is but how light weight the cooking pan is. Same simple features of low, medium and high and always good and safe for those amazing over night stews or yummy pot roasts!!"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall, I am very happy with the product. It heats up quickly and I was particularly impressed with how quickly it cooled off. I did have to use the high temperature instead of low on a couple of recipes, but I am not sure if that was due to the amount I was cooking or the Crock-Pot. My only concern is the lid. while beautiful, it seems very delicate."
"LOVE IT. Have a tiny one for ""baking beans"" and have a giant 7 quart for making giant pots of stew but needed a go between for regular size meals. This 4 quart is perfect. I love it. Perfect size!!! Started using it right away!!!  Easy to clean too ! You don't need anything fancy and expensive. Just turn it on and leave it. What more can I asked for. Plus it was inexpensive."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far, I have been happy with this crockpot. I have to say, it is built really well! It's durable and it is made from high quality materials too. That's the first thing I noticed about it when I opened it up! It's a basic crockpot, but it does everything you need it to do. This crockpot holds 4 quarts of food, so you have plenty of space to work with! You can cook food for 4 or more people in it, so it's perfect for a family.

Another cool thing about this crockpot is the control knob. Like I said, it's basic, but the control knob work really well. Off, Low, High and Warm are the 4 settings. They are really simple to use and each one is straight forward about what it does. It's really e..."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This crock pot is the perfect size for my fiancé and I. It doesn’t take up too much room on my counter and holds more then enough food for us which is great. It’s easy to use and easy to keep clean! I love that I can keep the crock pot on low all day while we are at work and dinner is done by the time I get home. Definitely recommend giving this a try.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought my slow cooker as an addition to my digital pressure cooker. I wanted to be able to just put a meal in to cook and leave it.  This is a great small appliance for every cook from beginners to old pros! Cant go wrong!
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really love this Crockpot slow cooker! It makes it so easy to throw the ingredients you want in, turn it on, and walk away knowing you will have a terrific dinner later without all the hassle of cooking. It's great if you want to make enough to have leftovers and is the perfect size for our family. It will also be very convenient for the holidays coming up. This is a great product and I would highly recommend!"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my crockpot as a gift for christmas. I always want a slow cooker but never thought about purchasing one everytime im out shopping. I must say this pot is great. I only use it once a month at the least and intend on using it more. The person that bought this as a gift always says she wish she would have purchased herself the same one.
Ive made great dishes with this ....soup, beeftips, pork ribs, roast, meatballs, rotel dip, and many more foods....in fact im makeing a soup in it at this moment....love it love it....."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Crock-Pot is a brand you can trust and is reliable.  This smaller crockpot is good for small families and side dishes.  It is easy to clean and fits in with almost any kitchen decor.  It heats up evenly and thoroughly and the dial is easy to see and use.  I just wish it had a power light indicating that it is on.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using this crockpot for over two months now. I have used it to make several meals including chili, soup, and barbecued chicken. The Crockpot itself is easy to use. Just put the food into the ceramic insert, put the lid on and turn it on. There are three settings that you can use. Low, High and Warm. I have mostly used the high setting for my recipes. Overall I would give this particular Crockpot 3 out of 5 stars. On the plus side, the unit itself is easy to use. It’s durable and heavy duty. And the price point is great. On the not so great side - there were a few issues that I found. The highest setting would be the only setting to cook things in my opinion. The low setting jus..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the perfect size crockpot for our 2 person family! I often times have way too many left overs using my 6 quart, but not with this one.  The oval shape also fits nicely into the fridge.  I've made chili, cream cheese chicken, BBQ pork, and Mississippi pot roast in it and everything has come out perfect.  Be aware the control is manual so you will need to be around to turn setting to warm after cooking for desired time.  I have not found this too be a problem."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This so called SLOW COOKER boils my food and it practically falls apart , which would be okay if I was making BBQ, but I do not want a roast to crumble as I cut it. I made BBQ ribs and they boiled and had a burnt taste. It cooks way too fast and you cannot leave it cook all day. I called crock pot and they said all the new ones boil, my old one never boiled and I could leave it on all day and my food was cooked just right, not the new ones, cooks way too fast. Would not recommend it as a slow cooker."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The classic 4 quart Crock-Pot makes cook and go meals a cinch.  Cooking for  two people, I found the larger 6 quart Crock-Pot cooking larger meals than my  husband and I needed;  I relied on the smaller 4 quart for most of our meals.  It did not disappoint.  The smaller Crock-Pot cooked each meal to perfection. The ease and convienence of being able to cook and go along with the Crock-Pot quality and durability make this 4 quart Crock-Pot a winner that every one needs to try."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Literally one of the best ways to cook a meal! Fire and forget! Nothing beats throwing your ingredients into a pot, turning it on and coming home to a tender and slow cooked feast! Sold at an incredible value, this 4 QT Crock Pot has enough room to feed my family of 5 without any issues and with everyone satisfied! If you don’t have one yet, pick one up and see what I am talking about!"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I thought the product worked fine. I do wish the court size was slightly bigger maybe a six or 8 quart. But for the most part it suits my husband and I just fine.  I like this product because it cooks food evenly. I’ve had some crockpots where one side or the bottom is more done than the rest of the meat or whatever is cooking. Another feature I would have liked would have been a timer to set for a future time, say while I’m at work. But I think it’s a great value for the money."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I own a total of 4 crock-pots and this is now my favorite one. It is the perfect size and it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. I love the fact that the temperature settings are accurate because breakfast is my favorite thing to make in a crock-pot. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Works well. The food comes out delicious and it’s so easy to use. Set it and forget it for a yummy meal at the end of the day. Would recommend for a smaller crockpot if you need to make a meal for one or two people.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent product!  Worked as I'd expected.  I currently have a 7-qt., which I love, but this 4-qt is much more practical for our family of 3.  Only wish it was programmable, but for the price this is a great addition to my kitchen.  I love that the bowl is dishwasher safe too."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a great crock pot. The settings cook slow or fast but also there is a warm setting. I also love the fact the you can the stoneware crock in the oven to crisp things up. This is really a great product!
"I thought this would be the perfect pot. However, the lid did not fit. I think the crockpot itself was not molded right. Left big gaps for steam to get out and the liquid to evaporate. It also boiled rapidly on low instead of simmering. I called Crockpot, they tried to tell me that it is their new design and I should not worry. Um, a crock pot is supposed keep moisture in not let it out with 1/4"" gap. Crockpot then asked me to send pictures via an email link. When I tried to upload the pictures, the message I kept getting was the that case was CLOSED and would not allow me to upload the pictures. Thanks Crockpot for both the excuses and the inability to show you your defect. I am returning!!"
"We have had this and other Crock Pot Slower cookers. This one has been our stand by as the temperature is consistent and the size is good for 2-3 of us. 
My husband cracked the stoneware so I'm currently wrestling with replacing the stoneware or buying a brand new one for just $5 more ... or upgrading to another one of the many others. We have found Crock Pot slower cookers to be the best and most dependable."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my new go to for cooking. After starting a new job, working late and with fall weather settling in I love this product. I put it on low and come home to a perfect meal. The 4 quart makes it so I have plenty of leftovers."
"I got introduced to a crock pot by friends who have been using it for decades. I immediately fell in love with the concept and got myself an inexpensive manual crock pot. 

The 4 quart is ideal for two people. I am single and can enjoy the meals for three days or I freeze leftovers for later use. 

The crock pot is light weight and easy to store. Cleaning is so easy since the the glass lid and the pot can be put into the dishwasher. I never enjoyed cooking before but really love to try new recipes for the crock pot. It is cooking without any mess and with a lot less time needed to prepare food. And of course you can put on the crock pot in the morning, leave the house for work, and come back to a ready meal in the evening.

I recommen..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Crock pot was great , it was a good addition especially coming up with holiday cooking coming up. We tried many different recipes and the fact that I could leave it as long as I did without anything drying out I was happy"
"I needed a new 4 quart slow cooker and this was so cute I thought I would get it. I have like 10 slow cookers, don't judge, lol. When I got this one and took it out of the box I thought, hmmm...that looks awfully small and it was. So I pulled out my 2qt and my 4qt and a qt jar. This is in fact a 3qt, possibly a 2.5qt. When you cook with slow cookers you are to only fill them 3/4 of the way full and when I put 3qts in it, it was full to the top, so I would say it is more like a 2.5 qt at best."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The slow cooker was easy to use and the meal came out really good. The ease of the button to turn on is nice but would prefer to have a timer built in to turn off on it's own. It's not bad if you are at home and keep an eye on your meal cooking. Overall a good value.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I LOVE my Crockpot 4 Quart slow cooker!  It is so helpful to be able to empty dinner in it first thing and come home to a nutritious dinner that I didn't have to stand over the stove for.  I cannot recommend the Crockpots enough.  This size is perfect for a family of 4 or less.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have this crockpot 4 quart classic slow cooker for a few weeks now and I love it. It is the perfect size for my family and everything comes out perfect every time. I use it about twice a week most weeks. It’s a game changer for dinner time for me. I love the set it and forget it. Come home to an amazing smelling house and a cooked dinner.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this and it came in perfect timing I cooked a roast and turned out delicious and juicy great cooker I needed a new and happy I received this one got plenty more meals to prepare and can not wait I live this little handy cooker perfect for me
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall this crock pot was extremely easy to use. There’s only one dial making it extremely basic and user friendly. I feel very confident allowing my children to use this crockpot. The size of the crockpot was perfect for our family of four. It easily fit a 4-6 pound pork roast. The look of the crockpot is what you would expect from your every day crockpot but just a smaller version of it. The small size made it easy to fit on my counter and also store. The only thing I would change is to include an indicator light to let me know that it is in use.  I am very pleased with the way the crock pot cooked the pork and the time indicated on the recipe was the exact time it took to prepare the m...
"I purchased this 4 quart Crockpot recently as a way to cook healthy meals for my family even with our busy schedules.  I am thrilled with it. It is the perfect size for whatever I want to cook from batches of stew, to roasting large pieces of meat or chicken/turkey to even desserts such as chocolate pudding cake. My kitchen stays cool while it cooks, it does not take up much space considering how large the pot capacity is. It is so easy to use-my teenagers are even able to put together meals using this crockpot. Cleaning is a breeze with this model! Some crockpots are hard to clean but this one it's so easy! We have been so pleased with this model and brand and the price being under $20 I plan to order one for gifts for all the graduates, e..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love using this for cooking nacho cheese dip in and letting my tenderloin slow cook all day long! We use this for cheesy potatoes as well! Good size, cleans up nicely. Will definitely recommend to others!"
"Crockpot 4qt Oval Black: I bought this at the store and had to search for one where the box wasn’t damaged. When I got home and opened the box to use it the front left side was crushed in to the point of being unsafe to use it. It was separated from the base with 3 accordion creases Based on the box, the only way it could be like this was for it to be packaged with the damage already there. I’ve owned"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This crock pot is great. Very basic.  If you want multiple settings, timers, etc, this one is not for you.  However, it is foolproof.  Warm/Low/High settings & no confusion.  It is the perfect size for a family meal.  I have a larger crock pot which seems to burn on the bottom if not filled.  The lid fits perfectly and the bowl and lid are easy to clean."
"I call this my Baby Crock Pot. There was a time when my daily cooking was for 6 kids and 2 adults, and I constantly used 2 of the big 7 qt versions of this crock pot. Now it's just me and I wasn't sure I would use a crock pot at all, but this 4 qt. baby is just perfect. I've had this for about a week and have used it twice already. The first time, I cooked 6 large chicken breasts and froze half of them. The second time, I cooked a pot of red beans (1 lb) and leftover ham. I've eaten those for 2 days and will now freeze the rest. \n\nThis is so perfect for 1 or 2 people to cook up a pot of something and freeze part of it for later. It would be a great size for making side dishes or even main dishes for a larger family when you don't need or ..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The classic 4 quart Crock-Pot makes cook and go meals a cinch.  Cooking for  two people, I found the larger 6 quart Crock-Pot cooking larger meals than my  husband and I needed;  I relied on the smaller 4 quart for most of our meals.  It did not disappoint.  The smaller Crock-Pot cooked each meal to perfection. The ease and convienence of being able to cook and go along with the Crock-Pot quality and durability make this 4 quart Crock-Pot a winner that every one needs to try."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Crockpot 4-Quart Classic Slow Cooker in black color is super handy. I like that it is lightweight. This size of crockpot is ideal for my family of two. It is also very easy to use. It comes with 3 different manual settings and an off button. The settings are low, high and warm. When the warm button is used, the food inside the crockpot stays nice and warm for a long time. What I love the most about this product is that it has a removable oven-safe stoneware. It is also dishwasher safe. It is easy to wash too. I've made some soups and chicken in this crockpot and they resulted in a great taste. I like that this product is stylish and makes delicious meals. For its simplicity and useful..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this as an extra because I have 2 larger ones, but I tend to use it more often than the larger ones because it’s just the right size. I love the convenience of putting something in the crockpot in the morning and having most of the dinner meal complete when I get home."
"My rice cooker died and i needed something so i bought the original Crock Pot. Walmart offered a low price and fast shipping! Item works great, but it is a slooooow cooker. My next purchase will be an Instant Pot. I am retired and can’t wait for hours for food to cook. Glad to have this, however, and, again low price and very fast shipping!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Crockpot 4-Quart slow cooker is great! I have used it everyday for a week since I received it. It is the perfect size for my family and has already made some delicious meals. It is very affordable and I would highly recommend it to a friend.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We have used our slow cooker for many dishes spaning at least the past ten years all being slow cookers from your company both big and small. I love to make soups, chili and stews for those times I have friends over for watching the game or just working in my shop on vehicles during a saturday afternoon. The cooker always comes in handy for those meals that ""when you want to eat it's ready"". The thing I like the most is that the unit will cook something while we work or it will keep the things we like hot until they are needed without fail. I have never had a problem with overheating or sticking of foods we prepare. I have found that there is nothing like walking into the house after a day..."
"Some of the reviews give it a low rating. My wife has used this model for many years, (probably 20 or so). I replaced it because she said it wasn't getting hot fast enough. I reminded her that it is a SLOW cooker but bought a new one anyway and gave the old one to Habitat For Humanity. I'm sure it will last for a few more years. It was used quite often when my wife worked. The food is always delicious when prepared in the Crockpot. It is an absolutely great product, my wife has 3, a small, medium, and large, even though there are only two of us."
"Me and my husband work far away from the house all day, this is the way to go! I love this slow cooker. Put the food in, store it in the refrigerator or put it on to cook right away.
This is a great appliance that I wouldn't want to do without!Just the right size, and a very nice color and smaller than those jumbo ones which i had from different brand. The crock comes out for cleaning. I leave it stay out on the counter since it looks pretty, and has a pleasing oval shape. It stays on the counter all winter. It is always being used almost everyday."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product was easy to use, right out of the box.  There was no need for instructions or extra assistance in setting up the crock pot.  Food was cooked thoroughly and kept warm and ready to eat.  Easy clean up!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought the crock pot weeks ago and it's yet to show up. It's just a basic crock pot with a easy off on switch that includes a high or low cook setting. I really like the black color and I can't wait for it to show up
I enjoy my Crock Pot {Slow Cooker} so much. It saves me a lot of time. It keeps the kitchen cooler and I get to enjoy food that's not fried. It's a lot better for me. I can do laundry or other things around the house while my meal is cooking. My Crock Pot is a life saver. I'm so glad I have it.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I LOVE my new Crock Pot!! I have already made so many things in it! Brisket, pork carnitas, beans and even a cobbler!  It so easy to use, creates amazing g smells in the house and all the food comes out tasting amazing!  Seriously don’t know how people live without one!! Makes great gifts too!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This crockpot is easy to use and produces delicious end products. I am able to put my ingredients in this crockpot in the morning and not worry about it until it is time to sit down and eat. I have made several soups as well as a meatloaf and all were well lived by my family and have even requested more crockpot meals!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought a programable slow cooker and within a year it started turning its slef off so I went back to the old reliable one and I love it I have also purchased the lunch size that my daughter and son in law take to work
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I accidentally broke my inner crock, I was so upset, I cried.  My son ran out and got me a replacement right away.  I own 4 of varying sizes, but this one is my fave.  I have  a large family, and leftovers are a bonus.  :)"
how soon do they restock?? i want one soo bad :(
amazing deal for such a good product.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's easy to set up and use.  The few recipes that are included are easy to follow and taste good.  The temperature settings are consistent as always.
I bought this crock-pot after breaking mine. I have been enjoying it immensely. I even used it to prepare barbecued chicken! This product is great because it means no more standing over a hot stove or being in the kitchen all day.
I really liked this 4-qt crockpot. I also have the larger one and love using it for family gatherings. It’s just so darn heavy! But this one is perfect for cooking a meal for my husband and me.
"It's just the right size for me. I just cook for one so it doesn't make so much that I have it for days and days and days, although I did get enough soup the last me about six meals!"
I bought this crockpot a couple of years ago and I really like it. It cooks well and is perfect for appetizers. I used it yesterday and the lid fell and broke. I can't find the replacement lid for this model. Is it available?
"I enjoy my new crock pot. I will recommend this product to all of my friends. Busy people need a better way to prepare cooked meals that are more healthy, and delicious."
This crock pot cooks all food too warm and it ruins the texture. I never use it for fear my food will be leather. I use my old dented slow cooker from crock pot so this one is a waste of money!
Excellent size and for Walmart neighborhood store pickup policy. That itself gonna beat Amazon by the wayside. Power ratings or this 4 qts size are enough to cook and bring it up to boil in 1n hour. 190 watts.
Very good slow pot. I just wanted a basic slow pot. But I wanted a 4 qt like the one I had for years that finally stopped working. I had another with more gadgets but didn’t really need anything fancy. This one works great
I have three Crock Pots and based on their reputation I bought a this four quart as our family has tapered down. After buying the four quart I purchased a two quart. You just can't go wrong with the original Crock Pot.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the red crock pot to replace a previous purchase. This is a great product and highly recommend!
I bought this and I love it I use it at least twice a week when I want to make dinner easy and convenient Im very impressed with it I would give it a 5 * well worth the price.
"I agree with previous reviews. The photo looks like an oval-shaped pot, so I was very surprised when I opened it and discovered it was round. The shape means that meats like a corned-beef that is a rectangle shape will need to be cut in half."
"WORTH THE PRICE!!! WORKS REALLY WELL THE ONLY QUIRK IS WITH THE LID ATTACHMENT ON THE BACK. AFTER REPLACING THE HOLD SCREWS WITH SOME NEW, STRONGER ONES, NO PROBLEM1111"
"I have been wanting one of these crockpot for the longest but didn’t want to spend so much money finally Walmart had it on sale, best thing I have ever purchased."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My Crock Pot of many years cracked and I replaced it with this new one.  Love it now, loved it then and will continue to use it.  Such a time saver!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got this as a present years ago and use it occasionally for group gatherings. It's always kept the food warm and tasty.
"Made meatball sliders and surprisingly it held quite a bit! It didn’t take up a lot of counter space but held plenty of food. 
And price was great too!"
i was looking for slow cookers yesterday and saw this one. i thought this deal was fake because how cheap but it is a very nice crockpot! we got the last in stock
Purchased for the Super Bowl in January 2019 and has completly cracked from normal use in about 10 months. Hamilton Beach slow cooker has lasted 10 years and never had the issues we have had with this crock pot in one.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Couldn't be more happy with my manual 4at Crockpot. It makes the best soups. Just what I needed. Thank you.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use my Crock Pot for meals at least once a week. It cooks the food thoroughy and the cleanup is quick and easy! I recommend this to any family of 4 or more!
"Love this. I had one this size that was programmable that never got hot, just warm. I tested this one out when I got it and it boiled water on high so I was very pleased with it. Great size for small dishes."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I am a terrible cook, but since I purchased it , I've cooked several meals that were great."
"omg..I love this product. Theres nothing like going to work and having dinner made when you come home.I love making pulled pork the best in my cooker, let it cook all day ,then add some sauce when I get home.Yumm"
Crock pot arrived quickly and is the perfect size for what I need. My complaint is that there is a couple of small chips in the glass lid at the edge. The owners manual says not to use if there chips in glass because it could shatter.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love my new crockpot I’ve used them since I was little and it works perfectly no matter what I’m trying to make. ❤️ My crockpot!!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought it because it was red to match all my other appliances and it was the Crock Pot brand. I never imagined that it would become the most used item in my kitchen.
"It has only three feet, what a crock!
.... two feet in the front, and one centered in the back
I wonder how much money Sunbeam saved by eliminating that fourth foot.
Will return asap"
This was just what I need for two people....I have the same size in round but I am liking this oval shape.
"Just what I was looking for 
Needed something bigger than the smallest but not too big. Perfect size for 1 person"
"small but practical for 2-4 people max, it works very well and clean up is fast and easy. Can't beat the price"
I don't  know  how    to  get  it  as  a  pick up   when I do not  have  a  phone  that   does  the  'App' thing  !!!!
I've had the scv400 model for several years and this morning had the handle break. I can't see a replacement lid on your website. Does it not exist?
I bought this for my daughter. She said that it was a little smaller than what she's used to but it got the job done. Cooks well!
"This looks like a well-made product, but cooks very quickly and too hot on the low setting. Really can't be used as a ""slow-cooker."""
Received this crock pot. And noticed right away it doesnt sit flat on counter. Too wobbly. Made me worried sbout spills. So it was returned
I have had my large crock pot for many years. And I can say this is the best one I've ever used. Just easy and reliable.
"I have a larger crock pot and needed a smaller one. This works perfect for smaller items to
cook in crock pot"
Purchase this for my military daughter and she loves it. Easy to clean up and cook it b4 going to work.
"Dented, lid doesnt sit properly and neither does the ceramic insert, only has three legs so whole thing is crooked and unstable. I'm returning it."
"lid knob screw is aluminum, and the threads were mashed flat so the knob fell off after 1st use.. not the stainless steel it should have been"
The Slow cooker I love it I can make my soups Stew and when it gets cold the Gumbo is next so I think it's a great thing to have
This is a nice slow cooker. I had a bigger one but it was too big.  This is a great size and the quality is great.
"ive only used it about ten days but its definitely what i wanted,,,easy to clean and basic controls, low, high and warm"
"Great price. Love manual because if we have power outage, and it comes back on, it continues to cook.  The auto setting one shuts off."
The bottom only has 3 legs! It's so wobbly there's no way I am putting anything hot in it! Not a smart engineering concept! Back it goes.
I really like my crock pot. The only complaint is lid just tad loose. I've used it a couple times so fair
I bought this 3 years ago and it was great... until the lid shattered during normal use. Hard to want to continue using Crock Pots if they're unsafe.
I have had my crockpot for years. Would highly recommend everyone having one. I am going to eventually get a new one with the stirring mechanism.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I just love using this cooker - the temp is right on and my meals come out wonderful.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Like the fact that it has a low, high and warm setting. Also love the color!"
"Great size, good price. Been enjoying remembering how to use a crock pot again. Had one in my 20s, I'm 65."
"I bought this crock pot but returned it before using it.  It only has 3 ""feet"". I didn't like the way it tipped to the side so easily."
"Perfect size for a family of 4.  If you have a larger family, you'll need a larger crock pot.  Works great!"
the lid does not seal therefore it can not truly keep in the juices and when it boils as it tends to do it evaporates the liquid and burns the food
Great crock pot purchased to make cooking at home a little easier during the Coronavirus pandemic. Good buy and works well!
It's small but it's great for just one person.  I love it.
Very nice sized crock pot for the price
"Great size for side dishes or for dinner for two!
The keep warm option is a fab idea!"
"Haven't used as yet, but I had a similar one previously and hope this one has a
similar life span."
I love everything about it!
Crock pot is the perfect size and I'm looking forward to using it!
"Works great, simple to use, simple to store.  Great price"
This crockpot is NOT 4 quarts.  It's only a 3-quart pot.
I love my little slow cooker
I didn't realize how small this crockpot was until after I bought it.
It was a gift for a friend of mines who is blind. They loved it. It helps with their independence.
"Stopped working after the first use!
You get what you pay for in this case unfortunately!"
I have used this several times and really like it. Great value at a great price
"Love this Crock- Pot.
ordered it to make chili for my grand babies, just the right size."
perfect smaller crock pot.  Works great and would buy again.
"Love the 4 qt size. Others that I currently have were either too big, or too small!"
Light weight but perfect size for so many things I cook.
Love it! Just what I was looking for. Perfect for myself and my husband.
I got this crock pot like 8 years ago (
Great cooker. Easy to use and to clean.
Takes forever to get warm! Does not get hot!
Just the sofa I need as a single person
Perfect size and weight for my elderly mom to lift and use.
Perfect size as I was needing...
"This crockpot is the perfect size for me, I like the manual kind better than the touch buttons."
it works great. just what I needed
"I have not used it yet but it is what I needed , the size and weight are great for us"
I like everything about. It fits perfectly in a area I wanted it for and it works great.
Bought this for myself because of the size it is just right for 2 people.
"Has a chip on the bottom, too bad."
Perfect size for a single person or a family of 2
House warming gift.  My sister is cooking and the food is ready when she is up and ready dir work
Love it..rival is a good quality brand. Looks nice too.
Very pleased with this crock pot
Great basic Crock Pot. Simple and perfect for occasional use.
"Works very well, perfect size for 1 or two people. Cord is very short though."
It is perfect. cooks my meat well and it did just what I needed it to do
The price and it is efficient.
I like it better for smaller groups
"perfect in between size, great for quick get togethers."
I love myself a slow cooker. Best appliance in my kitchen. Don't know where I'd be without it.
I love it. helps out on the hot days
Very good quality for the price
Not real big....like it a lot.
"been using Crockpot products for years. They're safe, dependable lifesavers for a busy Mom"
"Outstanding crockpot, cooks your food evenly, and the food tastes amazing!"
love love love this. works great. easy to clean. compact size.
It's very helpful. I use it to tenderize beef and dried beans. Takes time as i planned.
Bought for my dad for fathers day. He loves it. Great slow cooker. Great price for it as well!
Very poor quality. The rim (cheap aluminum) is slightly dented out of the box.
Perfect size. I have a 7 quart slow cooker
This is a good buy. Temperature settings work great and it's the perfect size.
Yes got package and love it
Sure is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.
Good product for a good price
This is the perfect size Crock-Pot if your are making a dish or soup for 2 people.
EXACTLY as expected! I have the 8 qt version
"I loved my Crock Pot, however, my lid shattered yesterday while cooking chicken!"
"Very disappointed with the lid. Was dropped in the sink by my 90 year old Mother, and it broke into ver tiny pieces!"
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM. COMFORTABLE AND STYLISH.DEFINITELY 5 STARS.WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THESE.GONNA GET SOME MORE FOR SURE.
I READ A REVIEW ABOUT THESE.I WEAR 12 AND I BOUGHT 13.FIT PERFECTLY.I RECOMMEND ANY SIZE YOU WEAR ADD ANOTHER INCH AND YOU WILL GET THE PERFECT 👌 FIT."
These shoes are easy to put on and very comfortable to wear. The color is the same as the picture. Highly recommend these shoes as an everyday shoe when walking around.
Lightweight shoes that fit perfectly
I like the black shoes at Walmart
My husband really likes these shoes
"If you're looking for a ""Proefssional Sakteobard"" shoe, this is for you! It's made so well that spelling is of no concern. Be assured that it will be the hit of the gifts, while everyone laughs hysterically at the tags sewn in them."
I was hesitating about getting these shoes took me about 2 weeks to think about it and I should have waited and thought about it I like the color I got the green one do you like that what I don't like about it there's no cushion on it it's like walking on concrete I have diabetes and looking for something that was comfortable because I walk a lot I live in Los Angeles volunteer skid row and walk a lot and there  not comfortable at all I'm so disappointed I should have waited don't get me wrong the lightweight they're easy to put on so my problem is the comfort they don't have
"Everything! You can see through the sides. Cheap plastic (not rubber) material for the sole. There are no labels with materials or size.  wording on tongue misspelled. Sides and tongue extremely thin. I would give it negative stars it was available to choose. Literally, a plastic bag would work better and be more comfortable."
I’ve never held cheaper feeling shoes in my hands.  I’d better stick to getting shoes at Ross for the same price that are actually nice
Garbage. Not safe for even walking. Thin and painful to simply walk in them.
very comfortable. wish had more colors!
comfort and same day delivery!
"Bought 8 and half got a size 10, uncool I am short can't wear them.
Live in the country hard time getting in town to return them."
"love these shoes, wasn't expecting them to be so comfortable, I ordered in mens size because my feet are xwide, so glad i sid that."
Not a running sneakers and the width of the shoe is small looks like for short leg
wore shoes once and the insole is sliding forward
very comfortable lightweight and easy to wear
poorly made cheap uncomfortable
"The only reason I returned the shoes is they were too big. I also bought another pair of the same, but a smaller size."
"i love these shoes. they sre comfortable, but they are narrower than i thought."
My husband really liked them.
really lightweight I would suggest replacing the insole
all and all great shoes for the price
I bought these for my grandson and he loves them. Good fit and comfortable.
Good sneaker for the price. Well ventilated and comfortable.
just what I was looking for very comfortable very cool super light shoe they're great
"A good seller, fast delivery, ordered one size, asked to send for a smaller size, the seller went to the meeting and did everything right. Recommend"
one shoe fit perfect the other shoe is tight and feels shorter than the other
i ordered a 9 1/2 and they felt like a 9 way to tight i guess you get what you pay for
"Very cheaply made shoes from China. Low price @ $20 so possibly not much to be expected. Have bought $20 shoes before and not as light and flimsy as these Hobibear shoes. Make my feet hurt due to no padding in sole and feel everything I walk on. Definitely not ""running shoes"" and more like slippers for walking around the house. Not for outside at all- too light."
"I bought these shoes for working out in the gym. Took a little time to figure out how to tie them right to not feel a little loose. Now they have been broken in, i like these shoes more then the nikes, Reeboks, adidas, or under armor shoes I’ve worn in the past. Highly recommend these especially"
"I lucked into getting these at the right size. They fit well, have good arch support, and are very comfortable exercise shoes. I don't know how durable they are, but they're comfortable for walking and running. Water gets into them fast if you step in puddles, so water is best avoided."
"Despite the large looking toe box (very wide looking in the front, different from product images), this shoe is well made, comfortable and surprised me with the quality. I bought one shoe to check them out. I like them enough that now I will buy them in various colors!"
I loved the color of these shoes when I saw them. I ordered hoping they would be that color and they came just as they looked. They are incredibly comfortable.
"I get a lot of compliments with these shoes. Pretty cumfy, though I did use an insole. Had to knock off a star, because the dye got on my white socks. Also the rubber has faded a little, not too big a deal, though."
"These are extremely comfortable, and felt ""broken in"" the first time I put them on! I usually need a wide...wide was not an option with these, but they fit great anyhow!"
"Exactly as described and fast delivery. The only thing I didn’t like was the packaging. By the time I received it, the shoes was all bent. Would be nice if it had a box."
Husband loves these shoes. Looks nice & says comfortable from day they came in. Ordered half size up from normal & fit good. Definitely recommends!
"This is probably the most comfortable running shoe I have ever had on. Granted, I am not really using it for running, but for walking and casual wear, but it is still easy to get on and off, and is as light as a feather. Try this and you'll never want another sneaker, running shoe, walking show, casual wear shoe again."
"Bought these shoes for work and loved them. Not only do they look good with all my clothes but they also are comfortable. In addition to comfort they are more durable than store brand shoes. I’ve kicked, stomped, wet, and anything else you can do in a shoe and they still look fresh!"
23 dollar Price for fairly well made shoe so far. Fits well especially for wide feet. 11 black and yet not many other colors available is fine. Don't expect a high end shoe or several years worth of wear. Go in with open mind not expensive and may get hopefully 6 months to a year. May buy another pair if after couple weeks these are still holding up..I'll update if anything doesnt live up to my expectations
"I have tried adidas, nikes, and all other sorts of bigger brand shoes. they suck. i finally got tired of spending the money on those shoes so i just decided to get these. these are extremely comfortable, look pretty good ig, and seem to be pretty non slip especially in wet areas. thinking about buying another pair just because."
"Bought this pair and was so comfortable- went on a vacation and some of the best shoes I have ever purchased. They let your feet breathe and stretch, that’s important with bigger feet. So great I bought another pair in a different color. Think the camo is still my favorite!"
They are comfortable for walking or workouts
My 12 yr old loves them fit great
Shoes fit great super comfortable.
Fit perfectly and I am still wearing them!
I like these shoes much more than I thought i would in the first place
I ordered these for my son to use for his job at McDonald's. The floors are greasy and slippery. He loves them and reported his feet were not aching after his 8 hour shift.
Great shoes for work. Glad I brought these. I was tried of wearing my boots to work. Now these are a comfortable shoes. Tight but nice fit. I recommend wearing thin socks with these for best fit.
"Hubby liked it. Was comfy, flexible, light & airy.. We think it’s just right for casual basis. He normally complains sneakers are hard and not comfy, he has flat feet and these he said was comfortable enough for him."
I used to buy all these expensive high priced name brand shoes but switched to off brand 1/2 the price shoes and they are better than the name brands and are more comfortable. I highly recommend.
"Very comfortable, had them for about 6 months and still wear like new after multiple hiking trips and general errand running. My mom is a chef and used them in a pinch and loved them so much I got her and my brothers pairs."
"These shoes are way better than I expected. They are durable, comfortable, light, and overall really nice. I was looking for a Nike and saw these. Thought I’d try them. I can return if they fall short of expectations. Glad I did. Love em."
Bought these as a gift for my husband. He is supper picky when it comes to shoes and he loves them. Says they’re are super comfortable and light weight. He wears an 11.5 and I bought the 12 and they fit great!
Fast delivery product is perfect and as described. I bought em a .5 size bigger to be safe in case of a tight fit but now I have extra room so order for your actual size itll fit fine. For the price perfect running shoes/work. Will be ordering more.
I'm absolutely stunned by how comfortable these shoes are and at a great price. Trust and believe these are comfortable and great if you have to do a lot of walking. I will be buying additional colors. You won't be disappointed
"Very light, easy to slip on and are comfortable. Great show to slip on quickly to run around with the dogs in the backyard. These exceeded my expectations."
I don’t typically write reviews. I love these shoes. Extremely comfortable. I also has people telling how cool they look. Extremely happy with my purchase.
My son needed these for work. They fit perfectly and he said they're very comfortable. He's in them for about 6-8 hours for his bus boy shift at work so he is on his feet all evening. Easy to clean too.
"Having two other pairs in other colors, I wasn't disappointed in my third pair of these. Quick transaction. Super comfortable. And the statement that they make have caught a few eyes!"
The shoes are comfy and many friends and family have made compliments about them. Some people think I've spent over 100 dollars for these shoes. Very durable and I'll definitely be buying more.
"They are comfortable, soft base, good material, I already tried'em for yogging and I'm satisfied with them."
The shoes run large. I wear a 9 and the 8.5 still has around an inch of room for my toes. Other than that they are great shoes
"I have multiple pairs, use one pair as slippers, have two pairs I use for taking the dog out. One at the front door and one at the back door."
"I was very pleased with the sneaker looks like the picture, light and comfortable i use them for work"
"Well it's safe to say now pure comfort from the day I received them up until this very day . Still kicking strong with durability , and comfort ."
Love these shoes! They look great and are very light and comfortable. I get more compliments on them than anything else I wear.
Super comfortable and look better than expected. I've gotten several compliments. Already looking to buy more in different colors
"My husband wears these every single day, to the point where I’m buying him a second pair right away."
"Really cool imprint. Love black and white design hope canvas last long. comfortable light, nice tough soles. Goes with anything I feel."
These are very good shoes at a great price. I actually bought this pair and te same pair in gray. Very pleased with both.
They fit well and have held up. Sizing was right on and well with the money. I will be buying more in the future.
Comfortable and sleek low key look. Worn for long hours standing/walking doing restaurant work. Non-slip.
Cannot express how much I love this shoe. It’s so comfy they are my everyday work shoe. Will buy more pairs!
Fit as expected and is comfortable
"VERY LIGHT JUST WHAT I WANTED. COOL AND COMFORTABLE, WELL WORTH IT."
"Having said all of that, I will replace them when they wear out, they are comfortable and cool."
I really like these shoes. Very comfortable.
Light weight and comfort.
Very light weight and comfortable
Very comfortable and they fit great!!
Fit very well and comfortable while walking and standing.
These shoes are great - got them and have worn them every day since.
I love cheap comfort and wide for wide feet
Perfect fit and so good on my feet
Good look fit as expected
Feels super comfortable and light weight
really work well. comfortable fit. very happy with my purchase.
Very comfortable and good quality lots of compliments
"Really enjoy the shoes, great price, delivered fast, get a lot of compliments. Thank you walmart."
"They are easy to put on.
I want to buy another pair."
"Good quality, as pictured. For bigger than expected but still pretty close to size"
"Easy to put, fits well and is very comfortable."
These shoes are extremely comfortable. The price is great and they fit well. They look good too.
"Design, confort, weigth are great but quality vrs price not sure"
I needed work shoes and feel more relaxing and flexible doing my job at work
I would never work out in these these are for casual attire wear
Son loves them says they are very comfortable
I like these shoes. Your feet will always fell great while wearing them.
Didn't expect this product to over exceed my expectations
"I have bought 3 pairs for my grandson
Great for spring and summer easy slip on."
I ordered these shoes for my husband and he really loves them. They look good on his feet.
Great shoe for the money. Fun colors and style. Excellent fit and comfortable.
"Nice shoes! They are light and comfortable. I am on my feet a lot, and these are great so far."
The fit and quality are better than I thought they would be.
Feels like slippers with the support.
Everyone asks where I got them from. Get lots of compliments
For work-out it's perfect fit
Fit great and hold up nice
Great for me
Great quality.
Comfortable
Very comfortable
Great workout shoe.
I like how why they are
Everything
Very good
Perfectos
I like everything about this product from the easy to remove plastic seal to the curved application brush. This mascara applies evenly to the eyelashes a thick luxurious coat of color. The pigmentation is dense and stays on for the duration of the day and evening. Great product!
Long lasting effect. Makes my lashes longer and fuller.
"Great product and a great company, absoutely love the way this looks on my lashes"
Bought this for my husband and he said it is a great piece of equipment for the money ...very happy with it...said it is especially good for doing sit ups....he is about 240  lbs...love the small footprint so it doesn't take up too much room
"The bench is easy to put together.  Nice bench for the money.  A little rickety on carpet, I am sure it would be more solid if placed on floor.  I wish they had made the front end support same as the back which is solid and flat - that would have made the bench a lot more sturdy regardless of where you placed it for use."
Feels nice quality but very hard to put together
"Would give a 5 star if not for my experience during assembly. Hopefully it was an isolated incident. 
So it turns out that the pieces are wrapped then held in place with tape. Not sure why they wouldn't use rubber bands. 
During unveiling, some metal fragments flew off from the various pieces right into one of my eyes! I had to contend with severe discomfort even as I carried on with assembly. In desperation, used a magnet to pull out the fragments out of eye socket.
There should be warning regarding this in addition to the list in the assembly kit. 
Pros
Clear assembly instructions with various drawings of nuts and washers to size.
Great equipment, fits small space and fairly sturdy.
It would be great to add some cushioning at points of ad..."
"This is a small, affordable bench. It works well for home use. We use It to lift barbells in front of the tv. It's lightweight, which makes it easy to move in the middle of a workout. It's not very sturdy for larger people and/or larger weights. It has nice padding."
"Detailed Assembly steps are not written in a step by step way
Is there any expert assembler available"
"I would have given this 5 stars because I liked the look of it, it was easy to put together and it was exactly what I wanted. HOWEVER, after having it for only a week it broke. While doing decline dumbell flys one of the welds popped and the bench collapsed under me and I nearly dropped the weight on my face. Still waiting on a reply from CAP. Spend a few more bucks and get a higher quality bench."
"AVOID 
To be honest, just buy a different one.  My product fits together loosley, causing instability.

Description says 300 lbs max, but when you get the manual it says 200 lbs person max, 100 lbs in weight max.  

Folding it up is neat, if it would fit any where. its still just as long folded up, and it wont even go under my bed because it makes and arch when folded."
"Terrible quality welds, the foot metal base broke clean off. Weight limit was never exceeded. Now I am left with a useless wobbly bench. Didn't even last 2 weeks of usage."
"Do not buy. This bench claims to support 500 lbs, including the person. Iâm 5â9â, 200 lbs, and this bench started collapsing on me when I simply sat on it. The bottom bolt where the incline support and the center frame support meet pushed apart. I followed the manual, word by word. But this was the result when I sat on it to test it out. This was a waste of my time. Based on the price, I shouldâve known better."
Better than expected. I am six feet tall and fits my workouts.
Easy to put together. A great new addition to my exercise regiment.
"just got this bench today and I can already tell that it is high quality.  the only downfall to it, is the back brace on the last hook is off by a little.  other than that you can't beat this for its price.  I would highly recommend it to anybody."
"I haven't built many things in my life, but this was super easy to build (with the right tools) and everything fit in perfectly. The bench doesn't wiggle around and it appears to be very sturdy so far! So excited!"
"This Bench came with many screws and lock nut bolts. I had to buy new ones at the Hardware Store. Also, lots of the holes, like in the seat and back bench did not line - up correctly.  It was tooooo frustrating to put together."
"Came in good condition and was relatively easy to put together by myself despite it recommending two people for assembly. The bench is good quality, and my only issue is that the backrest wobbles a bit but it's to be expected for the value. All in all a good product."
Fairly easy to assemble.  Metal is sturdy but bench is a little shaky where front stand connects to bench.  There is a pin that can be removed to allow the bench to fold and that is where there's a little room to move.  I may do something to improve this and stop the shaking since I don't plan to fold the bench up frequently.
THIS BENCH IS PERFECT FOR ME. THE FOOTPRINT IS RIGHT FOR THE SMALL SPACE IT OCCUPIES. I'M 200LBS AND IT HOLDS ME SECURLY. THE DIFFERENT ANGLE SETTINGS HELPS TO WORK DIFFERENT AREAS WHICH I'M ATTEMPTING TO TIGHTEN UP. I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.
"The bench looked good on the web page and the price and delivery were outstanding.  Packaged really well and each part wrapped in plastic.
Cons: Missing major plastic part to assemble, down time waiting …………...well complete my review when I receive my part.  Rest of unit looks good with quality for the right price.  Would have liked another tilt position on the adjustable back."
"After assembly, the bottom is not fixated to the ground properly. As a result, when I do presses the bench is literally moving left and right. I tried to fix it with paper without prevail. 2 star for what seems to be a manufacturing defect, but usable."
"It is not a very sturdy bench, it wobbles when you lay on it . Easy to install."
"Bench is used for leg crunches, ab crunches, and flood kicks.
Multiple exercises apart from weight lifting."
Taking this back to Walmart. Horrible design. I was unable to put it together as the holes are not cut in line so nothing lines up properly. Don't waste your time with the product!
Put everything together within the hr and a half. Read directions carefully but I was able to enjoy my workout with the bench incorporate all the body parts. Highly recommend it.
Not pefect but very good quality for the price. The delivery was horrible though. It took 15 days to get this bench. Walmart really needs to work on their delivery.
"This bench is an excellent addition to my home workout equipment. Sturdy, light, and flexible positions make it very versatile in my exercise program."
"It's ok, for the price.  The bench isn't long enough if you are taller than 5'8"" and the pieces do not stay together well.  Overall I would spend more money and buy something better."
I purchased as I believed it would serve as both a sit up and weight bench. Due to the placement of knee bar sit ups are very difficult and uncomfortable. The construction and quality is very good.
"Just got it a week ago and have used it lots. It's a little compact but works just fine. Light but quite solid, very easy to adjust. Can't do much better for the price."
"East to build, sturdy base and bench. 
I especially like the seat goes from below 180 to 90°

I'm 6'1 and would have liked it to be a bit longer but for the price this is the best bench here. Tremendous value."
We use this great little bench for working with weights no more than a100 lbs. It is great for all the exercises we do. We are able to store it under a bed. It is built very solid. I weigh 175. Just the bench for me.
Pretty decent and easy to set up by yourself. The instructions are terrible but it's pretty common sense and the hardware is packaged nicely. Just wish it had more than one decline setting.
The bench works exactly as advertised. The main drawback is that the bench is a little shaky in the back rest area. It would have been nice to be able to raise and lower the upper leg/thigh pads.
Thank you Just as describe easy to set up and very sturdy. Worth investing
"The gym bench is sturdy enough and the price is just right for the value and purpose. This bench is good only for medium built persons. I am 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 142 pounds. If you are much bigger and heavier, I do not recommend this for you because you won't fit on this bench. It looks very discouraging to assemble at first because there are so many parts but when you get started it would take you only about an hour to finish. You would need open/closed wrenches up to 3/4"". This bench is just right for me though so I am satisfied with the product."
"I bought this bench because the dimenions were right for my size with the exception of the height which I figuired was incorrect. All the measurements are wrong, the bench is 19"" H x 43.5"" L x 10"" W(center) 11"" head and seat. I would not recommend exceeding the max weight but the wields are well done. I'm 5' 9"" 200lbs and its works for me."
"This product is pretty well built ..I weigh 250 lbs and
it holds me ...But I find it very uncomfortable ...The
length of it is too small
I would not recommend it for large men or women ..
For smaller people it would probably be okay ...
So I give it a 2 star ..."
"This bench is well made and relatively easy to assemble. It is PERFECT for sit-ups, since it provides a lock bar for your ankles and padded cushions for the back of your knees. The bench surface can be adjusted to four different positions and the padded surface is comfortable. Padded handgrips allow exercises for the lower body requiring you to hold on to prevent the upper half of your body from rising off the padded surface."
"This is a great light-duty adjustable bench for the price. Although As mentioned in other reviews, I wouldn't recommend it for those who are taller than 6,0"" or those who intend to use this bench for training with moderate to heavy weight. (The instruction manual for this bench states that it has a max weight limit of 250lbs. And when combining your body weight with what you're lifting you can see that this can easily be exceed depending on the excercise performed.) ...I've exceed the recommended weight limit with this bench without catastrophe thus far, but you can expect to hear it ""creek"" a bit and I'm personally not 100% comfortable using it for dumbbell bench presses and such.

So, overall if you plan on doing light exercises that keep..."
"I'v had this bench a couple of days now and what everyone else has posted here is pertty much as it is.I chose this bench over the Gold's Gym one ($47) manly because of the looks. the only draw bak is the Ankle and Knee pads which get into the way of a lot of routines with bumb bells. And the top one can not be removed very easy after you put it on with water and it drys,So my tip to you is to use the water on one side which will pertty much be permanently and use a powder on the other side which will let it slide on and off eaisily thus the bar can be removed"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this bench. I'm only 5'2"" and work out with mostly free weights. My husband has a full size bench but I wanted one I could use for just basic exercises, and one that I could move easily. This bench is perfect for me. Love the incline and decline...so easy to adjust. Love the ab work outs I can do on it!"
I wanted to live this bench despite some bad reviews. Unfortunately I can't because I was never able to put it together. As soon as I got to step 1 I already knew it wasn't gonna happen. The welds are all off and almost none of the holes line up properly. The first of which in step one was about 2 inches too far up! Project doomed from the get go. Whoever is welding these for CAP is going to put them out of business if they don't find someone else. If I could give 0 stars I would. How could you give 1 star to something you couldn't even build. Poor quality control and poor build quality. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get something like a best fitness or body solid and you won't regret it. That's what I'm doing now. And if ...
"This product was purchased for my fourteen year old son.

Overall, the product was easy to put together and sturdy enough to support at least 200 lbs. I like the ability to adjust the back.

My son and I didn't realize the bars at the foot of the bench were stationary until after the bench was put together, which was disappointing at first.

I like the width of the seat because my son doesn't feel like he's going to fall off!

Basically, the quality seems good to me and my son uses it everyday, so there you have it!"
"Ive been using this bench for 6 months now, and so far this bench is still holding its ground. I'm a bit over 6 feet and weight a little under 200 lbs. I do most of my upper body workout with the bench; chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders some back, leg and abs exercise.

The weight limit (according to CAP website and manual) of the bench, user + weight is 300 pounds. I have tested the bench at the limit without stressing the bench, no squeaks, arcs, nothing so far. If you were looking for cheap but good bench in order to tone or gain some muscle; this is definitively a good bench for the work. Whether if your into fitness or want to start building some muscle. If you are looking to bulk up this bench wont last you too long but it will get yo..."
It was easy to assemble in about an hour. I found the pin adjustment for the raising of the back cumbersome to use. I had to look under to find the hole and line it up to insert the pin. The cover is cheap unbacked plastic. I took it back and bought a bench for twice as much that didn't have the faults I mentioned.
"I recently graduated college and moved into an apartment after moving for a job. I have always worked out for sports, and wanted to continue to do so without having to pay a gym fee. I also wanted to be able to workout whenever I wanted. I looked at other workout benches, but I was limited to a small space. When I put this bench together I realized it was the perfect size and it offered many options for different workouts, such as: incline, decline, and horizontal bench positions. You can also use these positions for sit-ups, as you can lock your legs into the foam leg pads. I also like that the material is tough, as it feels like it will last awhile. The CAP symbol is embroidered too, not just vinyl which is nice because it will not rub of..."
"Most unhappy with this product. The adjustable back bar does not line up flush with the stops. I fear the back arm will slide  out sideways and fall to the decline position. This is not a feeling i'm willing to have in the back of my mind when lifting weights above my head. Smacking myself in the face with a free weight is not a risk I'm willing to take. 

Also the leg supporting  the seat hinders my feet from being at a 90° and hip with apart. I will not sacrifice form. 

Overall the strength of the bench is OK. It's stable when stepping up or sitting down. however the design is slightly off and quite frankly create safety issues."
Everything is very sturdy and built solid. Would recommend for the price.
Arrived with parts rusting.  Parts don't fit together well either which causes bench to rock...and you can not adjust to level.
"Its price is not expensive, but not cheap. There should be some parts, nothing. Most unhappy time shopping."
"It goes together well enough, but is unstable. The feet are in constant movement when you sit on it or lay down on it. So it is really un useable"
"Nice bench, great price. Get a socket wrench and it will be easier to assemble.
It's a smaller bench, so it's not for tall folks. I'm 5'6"" and it's perfect for me. Lightweight, but sturdy and strong. I love it!"
I do like the product. Its got good structure the only part that is miss-leading it that unit is probably made for a female or smaller frame person. The bench is to small to accomodate larger frames. The unit is stable and sturdy.
I use it every night. easy to assemble but there was the back support that was improperly welded. I contacted CAP to send me a replacement part and have not heard from them. It has been about 2 1/2 weeks.
"Clear instructions makes assembly of this FID bench very easy. A very practical and functional design for someone who is 5' 6"" or shorter. I would not recommend this bench for folks who are taller than 5' 6"". Not bad for the price."
"This bench is awesome. I'm 6'2'' and it works great for the wife and I. It folds up great, it didn't mention it in the description. Very easy to put together. Definitely worth the money."
Great product for the price. Assembly was difficult. Very compact and slick.
"Built good, went together in about 25 mins. I'm 6'5 and it works perfect"
I bought this for my 10 years old son and he does set up on it every day and he likes it
Good bench over all. Not the best if you're a taller person as the backboard isn't very long.
Extremely comfortable and so easy to use
I wish i could give 0 stars bt this is what i can give right now worst quality
Pretty decent bench for the price.
Good bench. Strong and sturdy.
It's Terrible!!  Very poorly made!  I had to return it back to the store
The only negative is that it was somewhat difficult to assemble.
Pretty sturdy for the price. Great value. I'm happy with it.
Hard to build and squeaky
I bought this Two weeksago and I love it.. And it is easy to assemble
I bought this one month ago and I am so happy I did
Easy to put together  very wobbly
It does the job if you have light workouts 3/wk. A bit wobbly if you would use large weights.
"2 people to put together. 
Decent product for the price"
"This product would be better if it were more stable. Otherwise, great product!"
Great value very good quality
You going to need a socket wrench to assemble it. It's for short people. Bench a bit wobbly
"Plain and simple, it's junk. Too small for an average size man. Pictures do not portray how it looks up close. It is not advertised on Wal-marts site or CAP's site as being made for women but that's how it is portrayed on the box it comes in. I still have to dis-assemble it for return."
"This is great workout equmient for me I am a 5""11"" man and about 280 pounds it does not shake like the other reviews say it does and if you buy weight to go along with it it gives you six workout perfect for upper body and abs ( curls, dumbbell flys, crunches, leg raises, tricep kickbacks, shoulder press) and it can hold up to a 300 pound person with ease but I should say that if you are buying this to lose weight because your are overweight like me the chair on the bench will not fit your whole butt ( so you burn that big butt off) easy to build only about 9 pices and 27 screws if you do what the little book says all in all it is a good buy."
"Am only 5'11"""" and the length of the back rest is just below my shouder line. Take some time to assemble. Can be improved by changing bolt nut to allen heads with allen wrench included. Instruction did not indicated that some parts were already pre-assembled. Overall trims are nice and easily blends with leather and wood furnitures."
"The CAP workout bench was easy to put together and although it would've been easier for two people to assemble it, I was able to do it without assistance. I'm 5' 7"" and 150lbs and fit on it perfectly so if you are a little taller your head may hang off the bench for certain exercises. Also, the instructions to assemble were very clear and easy to follow, but I did not see the instructions on how to collapse the bench which was one of the main reasons that I bought it. No worries however, it has made working out VERY EASY and IT'S THE PERFECT PRICE! GO FOR IT!"
"I wanted an inexpensive, compact, and good quality bench for my small workout room. This bench was perfect. I read many reviews and knew it was on the small side, but I am only 5'8"",160lbs. My head just does rest on top of bench, so Bigger people may be dissapointed. I found it easier to just use the assembly diagram, than following the step by step instructiions. The front section does fold under to store. It's not Gym quality, but it is just fine for home use."
"Overall it is solid, a good value and my wife loves it. The length of the seat cushion is a bit short for me. Some of the edges were a little sharp where they met during assembly (nothing that would be a problem in use) and required a touch up with a file. The package arrived with a few wrong pieces for the dumbell holders underneath. I received a response to my email within minutes and the parts arrived within a couple of days, great customer service!"
"I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't find a picture on the web that shows this bench folded because one of my main concerns were storage. It still takes up a lot of space in its folded condition. However, product is very light in weight which is great for easy storage. Definitely not meant for big people. Overall I give it 3.5 stars out of 5."
The bench serves the purpose for my basic weight lifting exercises. It is collapsable to hide in corner or lean against wall or hide under a bed if there is room. It will incline and decline one step for most basic exercises. The covers are stiched well and assembly was easily done by myself even though instructions recommended two. Made in China. I had to move the bench out of the house for a couple days for the vinyl smell to disapate.
"I am a beginner, I wanted something for home that wasn't a huge piece of equipment & didn't cost a gym membership. I had no problem with assembly. I like the knee & ankle pads to wrap my legs around for sit-ups. The backrest adjustment is simple & easy to do. This bench is solid & sturdy, no wobbling & the price is great."
"Easy to assemble. Small size. Safe and sturdy to use. Nice for a small space. If you are tall, this wouldn't work for you. 5'8"" max."
"Excellent bench for the price, sturdy construction. It can be assembled by one person, but, 2 works better. Quite happy with the product."
"Definitely not for a large person. I'm 5'3"" so it's fine for me. Easy to assemble and sturdy . Good buy for the price."
I bought this bench and had it for two days. It is very well made. The price is great. Assembly instruction was easy to follow. I returned it because the gap between the seat and back support makes it very uncomfortable for doing sit ups.
"This bench is great, it was what i needed, also easy assembly. Both me and my wife use it for crunches , leg lifts and as a dumbell press bench could'nt ask for more."
Love it thanks
Perfect for home use.
"Not as stable as more expensive benches but fine for me. I weigh 150 lbs.

Very precise direction guide for assembly . Don't try and build based on the picture alone. Read the assembly guide and go slow and you will save time not having to re-do things. The instruction guide refers to the bolt or washer #s so keep the card that the bolts are packed on to confirm the size and #. You definitely could use a ratchet to save time and the bolt heads are 14mm."
"The bench was as advertised. It is sturdy and well made. Assembly was not difficult and I did put it together without assistance from another person as advised by the instructions. Follow the directions and you should have no trouble.

My only complaint is the bench does not support my head when laying horizontal. I am 5'6""."
I bought the bench just for everyday use around the house. I wasn't expecting much but I am very impressed with the bench so far. It wasn't very difficult to put together by myself. Seems very stable even though the description says it will hold a max weight of 250 lbs. For the price you can't go wrong.
"I purchased this product for in store delivery. The product arrived early and it was packaged well. Upon opening the box everything was in place and all of the parts were intact. I was able to put the bench together within 45 minutes. The bench is compact and stable. I am not the largest person but the seat when the bench is in the maximum declined position the seat is a little short. However, a slight adjustment make the seating comfortable. Overall the bench is great for the price. I highly recommend for small built or small framed people..."
"Value for money: Very good
Comfort while exercising: Very good
Assembly time: about 1.5 hours, good instructions
Back of cushion: Could be made a little better but ok for the money spent (just staples)
Storage: folds up well. About 15 inches folded
Overall satisfaction: Excellent, Great value for the money and felxibility of working out at home.
Definitely recommended."
"This seems to be a quality bench, however, if you are a bigger person, it is a little on the small side. I am 6 ft tall and cannot hook my legs on the ankle support and have room for my head on the bench, it hangs off the end. It would be a great bench for a shorter person, but would not recommend it for someone my size."
"I spent a lot of time researching cheap benches. I just wanted something basic that I could lie on my back and do flies and presses on, but comfortable. The cushioning is good and the components were much better than I expected for $50.

Solid basic bench. I recommend it."
Doesn't give a sense of being sturdy as it wobbles quite a bit when doing various exercises. I feel as I am about to tip over to either side but I don't think I actually would. I have gone back through and reassembled a couple places to make sure I had it right and tight enough. It just the way mine is I guess. It does the job and was cheap though I probably would have spent a little more and gotten something else if I had to do over again.
"This is a great product. You have to be under or up to 5.5 ft. You also need 2 people to assemble, sturdy and light weight product looks just like the photo. I live by myself and it took me about 2 hours to assemble just because I had no one to help, femail middle 50's. Don't know why others gave it a bad review. The price worth the product. Very fast shipping 3 days arrival."
"Great product at this price range. Looked at many and this offers the most at this price point. I use it mainly for situps, but it can be used for many other exercises as well. Can do lower and upper abdominal workouts. Can hold weights to allow you to lift light weights. Can change slant degree on bench. Foldable as well. Bench a little short for taller people. I am 6'.

Would highly recommend. Don't need to spend more on more pricey benches."
"I think this is a great product for the money. I don't have a lot of room in my apartment and yet needed a weight bench. I can move it around if necessary.. not like the benches that are so heavy you can't drag them around. One thing, you will have to put this together screw by screw but if you have patience you will be fine. I'm over 65 and just sat down on the floor and worked through it bolt by bolt. Having a few socket wrenches will make your life easier!!"
"If you are interested in a decent incline/decline bench, this one is great! I'm 5'4"" and it works great for me, but I can see where someone taller than me by a few inches might have a problem as it is low to the ground and not very long. Since the seat is stationary and only the back can be put down, it does make for a more difficult workout. You really have to bend your back (which is GOOD!) to use it, and it is GREAT! I love it, it is perfect for me and what I wish to accomplish (lower, mid and upper abs, lower back strengthening)."
The max weight capacity details about this bench are not clear.  Please read carefully.
Well made. Great price. Versatile bench. Truly a great value.
"This is sturdy, well made bench. It is a little short, but it doesn't interfere with sit ups. I'm 5'5"""
"Used this a few times now and I am pretty happy with it. It's not the quality you would find at your local gym, but for this price point it's well worth it. I'm 195 lbs and have used 50 lb Dumbbells on it and it was plenty sturdy. Nothing bad to say at this point, it seems well made, will have to see how it lasts"
"Extremely unstable!! All bolts put in correctly and screwed in as tight as possible but still very much give to them and wobbly. Extremely difficult and DANGEROUS!! Almost killed myself when the bench leaned to the left when I was pressing light dumbbells. Design extremely uncomfortable. Front leg cushions are awkward and basically irrelevant. If you take them off and try to use without leg cushions, there is metal just sticking out that you are sure to cut yourself on. Even though it's relatively cheap, you will find yourself not even being able to use it because it is impossible to actually work out on."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this bench. Not only does it have incline/decline settings but it can function as a flat bench as well. It was a little puzzling to set up at first with all the parts but once i geared down and got started it was easy. Good lucks, light weight and pretty strong."
"I'm a female, 5'2 and weigh 155 pounds. I have a lot of hip and button so the sit is very small. I believe the sits could have been a little bigger. That's the only problem I have if it. If you my height and weight but no hips and button, it wil be a great sit."
"Not a bad product, but it is not meant for bench pressing, whether flat or incline. I'm 165 lbs and dumbbell benched only 110 lbs (incline) and 130 lbs (flat), but it wobbled and felt unstable. The way the supporting strut fits into the base is not secure. For home workouts, I think a cheap flat bench is better; a fixed design would probably be more stable."
this is obviously a bit smaller than the benches you see at 24hour fitness. I bought it because I am a stay at home mom that needs to exercise everyday and this is the perfect product for that. This is not the kind of bench that you would get for your husband so he can workout in the garage. this bench is great for someone of smaller size. it was a little difficult to put together so I would have someone help you.
"If you're looking for something not expensive but that will get the job done, this is it! It did take some time to put together but was not necessarily hard. However, the directions say you may need a hammer, a couple wrenches, and 2 screwdrivers. I used none of those. But I would NOT have been able to put it together without various sized socket wrenches. I can't say how well it holds up yet but for a petite female frame lifting no more than 15lbs im sure it will work nicely. It seems very sturdy."
"use it in my Semi, just amazing ..  true kind of wabbles but nothing major that affects my workout. I'm not tall so triceps workouts was the reason I've bought this and I'm glad it did! other benches are high and the weight hits the tip of the bench and ruins the workout!! one issue which is decline position isn't comfortable for crunches and chest workout!"
"Satisfied with the product and price overall. Assembly wasn't too difficult (all of the parts were present and fit as intended). Could stand for the bench to be a little longer as my son and I are both 6' tall, but able to make it work for bench press and sit-ups without any discomfort. For the money, this bench is a good value for all of the functionality it provides."
"My wife, a long time runner, has taken up weight lifting as she finally recognizes it is as if not more essential for overall fitness. I bought her this bench as it will support her 130 lb frame plus dumbells up to 20 lbs. It is versatile enough to allow for many exercises and core training. This bench would not support an experienced trainer though."
"You get what you paid for. The bench gets the job done, but not without some help. BEWARE: this bench needs to be assembled with a wrench. The screws will not screw on using your hands, and the bench itself isn't 100% flat. It is wobbly and feels rather flimsy. 

As most benches are $150+. I'd say this is basically the equivalent to quality of $50."
"First, it's not stable at all!! If you lift heavy dumbbell, you need to keep your back firmly otherwise you will fall off the bench. Second, it does not have ANY tools for you to assemble it. Even you have the tools, you have to strong enough to screw it. So it helps to train your  muscle before using it"
I really like it after assembling. It's just what I needed. The only thing I was unhappy with was the fact that the seating pad the measurements of where the single screw had to be put was really off so I could not put the screw in luckily I was able to put the two back screw tight enough so the seat will not shift at all. That's my only complaint but for the price it works for me for what I needed it for.
"A very nice little bench that is very versatile. It's a little on the short side, but I guess that's the whole idea of a dumbbell bench, to be compact. Not too hard to put together, either. The various positions are just right, too. I would buy it again."
"Great, easy instructions. Less than 1 hour to put together. Good, sturdy product in comparison to other benches out there and great price. In the end, when you apply the foam padding to the bars, you only get one chance because once you place water and it slides on and it dries, you can't get it off to re-adjust!"
"I have a limited workout space in my home, so this
bench was a perfect fit and a great value. I am
also short and this bench is made with the smaller
adult in mind. Yet it is very sturdy, easy to adjust
for different exercises and was quite easy to put
together. (A rachet wrench really helps) I particu-
larly like that the bench adjusts in the decline posi-
tion...rarely seen in other products ... which.offers a
much wider variety of exercise options."
"Cheaply made and not very sturdy. I will definately buy something else next time, as I do not expect this one to last long. Not worth the money."
"This is an awesome piece of workout equipment for the price, but putting it together took me at least an hour and a half.  The quality is great, and it does everything we need it to do."
"I needed an inexpensive bench to work on my ABS, and this is it! Good value, good quality, don't hesitate to get if you are too lazy to go to the gym, and you'd rather exercise at your own home."
This bench is a piece of crap from assembling it (virtually impossible instructions) to quality. Don't waste your time or money on this. I threw it out.
"I gave this item 2 stars because it arrived promptly and it wasn't very difficult to put together. With that said, the customer service is atrocious. I would NOT buy again!"
I am six feet tall and 185lbs. It was a great bench in my opinion. I've been working out on it for last couple weeks and I don't see any problem with it so far. It's easy to adjust to make sure my head rest on the bench not over it.
"Very easy to put together. It's not made for tall people. I'm 5'10"". When doing sit ups I'm sitting in the crack between the two cushions. Other than that it is a pretty nice bench."
"Great little bench. It does take up much room. The only thing I would like is the back bench to have been a bit taller, but this helps with the space saving."
"no no no. this thing is not good for adults. it's small. if I'm lifting a bit heavier,. it's worse. I do not like it. it should not be sold over $25. spend the money and get a quality product."
"It was a little confusing to put together, but it seems sturdy. The only thing I don't like right now is the padding. It's very hard. It's like there is no padding in it at all."
"I was looking for a cheap bench to use for dumbbell exercises and maybe some incline sit-ups. This is the cheapest one I could find and it does the job. Nothing fancy, but it meets the expectations of an adjustable bench under $100."
"This is a simple bench with some additional features. The ability to change the incline of the bench, including negative incline, is nice. Opens up more exercises. Sturdy and easy to set up. Comfortable for most basic workouts."
"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, he absolutely loves it. It's very sturdy, and looks great compared to others we looked at. A lot cheaper too."
"I really love this bench, It is well built, strong and has a very nice finish. Is easy to put together. I am so happy with it, that I leave it in living room. I am alone, so I can do that!"
Bench is perfect for my one bedroom apartment. it was easy to put together and when not in use it can be easily stored out of the way. Great value for the money and has come in handy for those midnight workouts after eating too much during the day!
"This is a good product. It is somewhat cumbersome to put together, but once done it is pretty sturdy and of good quality.
Not as big as I expected, good for my size but tall people might have problem fitting in."
"I like the bench, but one of the screws that came with it was messed up, so I had to go out and get another one. It's not quite as stable as I had expected, however, it does the job."
"Solid and well made, it assembled easily and works well. The adjustable back could benefit from more than the 3 positions, 5 would be nice. The back edge of the seat hits my tailbone in a bad place, but that's just me. A great unit at a good price."
"Issues: One of the bolt holes are not alinged on the seat, so it is missing a bolt. This is a common fail with CAP equipment. (Bench is sturdy however.)"
I have used it very little so far but seems to hold very well. The installation was simple just the bracket that holds the front end where the pin goes came bent so I had to hammer it a bit to make it fit right.
Able to do lots of exercises on this bench. Kids love to sit in it and read at different angles while reading. But for the workout purpose it is everything we want.
"The bench is a little on the small side, however, I knew that before buying. I have very limited storage space, so the fact that it folds up and can be hung up in the garage is a big plus for me."
"The bench comes in like 27 pieces with a kit full of screws and bolts. I tried to put it together for a few days. I finally gave up and returned the item. Figuring out how to put the pieces together was ok, but many of the screws did not fit or screw together easily. The directions recommend that you have several wrenches and other tools in order to aid in the process of putting this bench together. I wouldn't recommend this item unless you have a lot of time on your hands."
"The quality of the product is good and looks durable but some parts of the installation were defective and made the bench unsecure.
I contacted capbarell and they didnt even took the time to reply!!! 
Bad customer service means bad product in my opinion."
Product price and quality are very good. Good value for the money. Allows me to do all the exercises I want without the frills. Just right!
Bench is good quality and just what I wanted. The only thing that I wish it had is a weight bar stand.
I am 5' and every bench I have bought they are too tall to reach the ground. Can anyone recommend  an adjustable bench?
Thouh a bit challenging to assemble it is surprisingly versatile and occupies little space. Is also lighter than others
"The fact that it's  compact and suits the whole family's needs is great. Couldn't ask for anything more, and the price point is perfect."
took awhile to put together but I love it...easy to use..came with an exercise program that is easy to follow...would recommend it.
It's gonna meet your expectation. The only thing is get ready for a looong and kind of complicated setup.
Surprisingly strong and quality made for such a small price. Will last many years if used correctly.
I would not recommend this bench. It is cheap and is not of good quality. Bolts will break and strip.
Great workout bench - I researched tons of different benches and this is a great deal for an incline bench! Extremely sturdy! Easy to assemble!
The bench is a little short and does not support the head when doing decline work. Overall- satisfied with the product.
It has motivated me to workout because is compact and you can place it everywhere at home. Besides relation price/quality is excellent.
"The bench itself is very sturdy, although the seat is a bit flimsy if you're heavier. All in all I love it!"
"Good size bench, very sturdy. My husband put it together saying it did require more than the simple tools listed."
"Product received exactly as described. Good size for a 5' 2"" girl like me. Stable enough for tricep dips. Easy to assemble (even for a girl)."
"Great price, excellent equipment for doing sit-ups, push-ups and dumbbell exercise.  Folds up for storage in need be."
"Upon receipt the product surpassed my expectations. Sturdy, stylish, well built, and easy to assemble."
"Just as Described!
Fast Delivery, good quality!
Make sure to have 2 wrenches to build this product up."
Easy install and easy pick up on store-to-store order. Also I did love that extra savings I received for do sight to store.
"This is a nice work out bench for great price, assembly and instructions were easy to understand. Thanks"
"I bought this item for my son's birthday and he likes it very much,because of limited space in the basement it is perfect for what he uses it for"
The bench was easy to put together. The whole family is using it. Great piece of equipment for the price.
"My husband uses this thing daily and for the price you pay, if you want just a basic, no frills weight bench, then this is the product to buy."
"I was a little skeptical because of the price, but this thing is actually a phenonminal buy and it's really sturdy and comfortable too"
This bench is very good at a very reasonable price. It is sturdy and will stand up to any task. recommended!
"I had to give it back the next day! Very poor quality, very light, very cheap made!"
Very happy with it for the price (and assembled it myself)!
"Good bench for the price, could be a little sturdier"
Good value for the money. Instructions for assembly were pretty good too.
I love this bench because it's portable and comfortable!  Also like the multi position back!
Very good ! Just need to spend little time to built it up!
I'm pretty short so it actually works good for me. Was easy to put together also
"The product was easy to assemble, very sturdy!"
very good product for the price
"Just ok, made for smaller people like 175lbs."
GREAT bench at a even better price. Best bench on the market for under $100...
Bench is what I hoped works for the work out I'm doing
"great for the price, easy to put together with socket wrenches~"
I was looking for this item and it was easy to assemble.
"sturdy, compact, very well made, suits my needs perfectly."
Easy to assembly and accommodate to small place. Very versatil since there is a variety of excercises you could do with this bench. Specially abs☺️
The bench is easy to assemble and works great... very pleased.
"Simple to put together, easy to put away.."
My 55” vizio went out after 12 years. I was very nervous going with a cheaper tv but I have to admit I LOVE this tv. It is super loud and I usually keep it at 14 or lower. The screen quality is way better than expected! I would definitely recommend this tv!!!
I purchased this tv for the frontroom of our new home. Right now we just have it on the stand but we have a wall mount for it but have to paint wall first. We really love the TV it has a great picture and it was easy to set up. We do wish the remote was a little bigger cuz with it being small its easy to loose lol. The price was nice too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
I purchased this TV in Jaunary. Here it is mid-November and the TV is great. I love it and have no problems. You want a good TV without the high cost of paying for the name brand (which in most cases don't mean a thing) then this is the one. Easy choice.
"Walmart kept me updated for every step of the delivery. Just like Amazon, their delivery person sent a picture of the tv on our doorstep! The setup was quick and easy but if you’re a small person then it’s better to wait for a friend as the TV itself is pretty large although light. Everyone who’s left a bad review has either been unfortunate with FedEx or did not read the instructions that tell you not to put pressure on the screen itself. There are paddings on the side to help with grip during the unboxing!!!"
"I love my Hisense 58 inch smart tv...and the low purchase price of $298.00, thanks Walmart.  The picture is really clear and the colors are great.  I am so grateful the sound is great too, I did not have to spend more money on good speakers.  I love the height of the tv...it's taller than alot of the large screen tv's.  Less than 15 minutes to install the feet on it, upload channels/networks, and set it up to wireless.  Works with Apple Play, Apple HomeKit and Hey Google.  Walmart always has great products at really great prices.  Thanks Walmart and Hisense."
this TV is really nice clear picture the sound is kind of low but I could always hook up surround sound to the TV I did a lot of Investigation because I never heard of this brand TV before I'm glad I chose it the experience with this TV I've had so far it's been wonderful
"I love this TV or at least I really want to. The TV itself is huge and has a beautiful clear picture. It also has great customization features for video and I like the options of different audio settings it provides. I
am pleased, however, it keeps losing my WiFi connection forcing me to restart the TV. It’s very inconvenient. I have a TCL and Samsung smart TV’s that do not do that. I’m not sure why this one does. I only live in a 900sq ft building so it’s not very big at all. I should not be losing connection as it doesn’t happen with any other of my devices. I’m hoping it will stop losing connection as I really love the TV!"
"i don't know who's fault (walmart or fedex) but the box came all punched, they HIT it so hard that broke the box, the plastic bag and scratched the tv. if the hit was on the other side, it would broke the screen. i won't even plug in the tv and make the return right now !! i've been waiting for this product for so long, and now this.. i have to wait to fedex to take it back and wait other 2 weeks for the replacement to arrive !!  you already have my money and i don't have my tv.. it's the second time that i buy something from walmart app and it came damaged, what's going on in the warehouse ??"
Every Hisense 50 inch tv i have got has crapped out within 2 years i have bought 3 this one only lasted a year got fed and called the company they have made almost impossible to get the tv replaced. They finally agreed to a refund after sending pictures 5 different times in a month finally the tech came out but could not repair tv. These people are very hard yo work with and do not respond well. Communications are lacking in know what they are telling customers snd you have to baby-sit them to get anything done.
"it was great while it lasted... LESS THAN 1 YEAR.  While watching it one day the TV screen went black, then filled up with faint wide colored bars.  Nothing i did would make it respond or reset itself.   After sending many pics to manufacturer they determined it was a ""panel issue"" and advised TV would be destroyed at my home by service people.    Once they received confirmation it had been completed, they shipped me a replacement by FedEx.  It looked fine..... until we set it up, plugged in, and turned it on.  All I got was a weird spiderweb  displayed UNDER  the  clean and intact screen.  Looked like cracked glass.    and the TV would only turn off and on, never got a picture on it.      I hounded them and hounded then for a refund since it was under warranty.    and for the $56 EACH!  disposal fees  I had to pay to get rid of that junk.      Hisense refunded ONLY my purchase price, not the extra $112 bucks i lost sending for proper disposal.       if you read through some of the bad reviews you'll see that this is quite a common issue with this manufacturer."
"I dont understand they take our money when we pay but our refunds may take up to 3 days, This tv was for my kids and i would have loved to just purchase a new one with this money while im in Walmart returning the defective one, not to mention the gas to get to Walmart then THE WAIT"
"I was excited to get such a great price for a 4K Roku TV for my in-laws however, the item arrived damaged right out of the box. I will return to a Walmart store as a replacement option was not provided online. I update the review based on the customer service solution and our ability to obtain a replacement for the same price."
"My TV was 10 yo,I definitely needed to upgrade, couldn't be happier with my 58"" Hisense 4K Roku. The picture is great,and infinitely adjustable,the sound is good,but I am a soundbar/subwoofer guy anyway,for that theater experience,and thumping music. Trying to get to used to a remote without numbers,not even with my universal remote,but I'll adapt. One thing is that I cut the cord on cable,I get 60 broadcast channels,and started streaming,but with a marginal Wi-Fi signal,but free. Now with my new Hisense, I'm having to use my mobile Hotspot,I get 40 GBs a month,but definitely not free. Definitely a major bonus is this is an inexpensive TV, about a third of what I paid for my last TV,and I got a pretty reasonable 4 year protection plan, for some piece of mind if anything goes wrong. All in all,just a great purchase."
Purchased this tv at the end of September 2022 the tv will randomly turn off or go to the main menu. When trying to stream apps it will say it needs a software upgrade in order to stream and when you go to upgrade the software it says you have the latest version. Keep trying to watch tv and it keeps going to the Home Screen.
Ordered online and first off it was stuck in Wisconsin for days. After being told  they couldnt locate the TV they insisted i had to get a refund. A week later the TV showed up with extreme damage and they want to charge me almost $200 more than the initial selling price of my original purchase.
the shipping took from forever was supposed to be delivered by Walmart was out for delivery got delayed I canceled my order they sent it FedEx that got delayed and then finally delivered that being said this TV is absolutely beautiful it made it in one piece packed beautifully safely and in good condition the picture and sound are perfect and amazing I'm very pleased! easy setup lots of free channels I already had a fire stick but this has everything I need on it!
i don't know what's going on but this tv is horrible. this tv has stopped working. the tv screen is just blank. this is actually the second tv and the other one was the same way.
"Horrible, my TV came broken... couldn't see the TV screen at all. I'm completely upset I'm super frustrated. My wife was expecting this as a early Christmas gift and it came on and it was broken. I'm super upset"
"I love my TV, it works great, the picture is awesome like an 8k, and we still have the 4k. My husband's tv died and it was a name brand, he switched to Hisense Roku because he liked my TV better. I love the apps and the games."
My tv arrived damaged it has a large crack on the right side with a huge black spot almost halfway through the screen. i demand that this is rectified by y'all coming back and picking this up and bringing me one that isn't broken!!!!
"So far no dislikes, very nice tv. Easy and quick setup with nice picture and better sound than Vizio. I would definitely recommend buying this Hisense television…."
"Bought in november 2021, everything was great but lines started to form from the right side of screen. must have been an issue with the bulbs. it got worse over time, a tech came out, said it was a covered loss so i was told i’m getting a full refund because they don’t make this model anymore apparently? anyway. i liked the tv just wish i could’ve used it longer"
"I would not recommend.  Roku overheats.  Called Roku for support, they said it was a hardware issue and told me to call Hisense.  I called Hisense and they put me to Tier 2 support, which means nothing, because I can't return a call to Tier 2 support, all I can do is start all over with Tier 1.

Will be returning this TV shortly."
I recently purchased this TV in store and price matched it to the Black Friday Early Access deals price for $198 so hear me out.. the reviews for this TV are awful but most of them are shipping related. I would not recommend shipping a TV but always getting it in store. As for quality I'm very impressed for the price I paid. I personally accepted that it was a hit or miss and I could purchase the Allstate 4 year plan on top of it. So I feel like doing that I got my values worth on a TV that actually is pretty nice. I will say though I could understand how in shipping things are damaged and you could be very mad. But I was lucky enough to have it in stock at my store and to just bring it home.
"screen was broken when television arrived. to avoid waiting a week to a month for a refund I had to return TV to store in person. refund was not full purchase price and delivery fee plus the price of uber two directions. due to the broken screen and having to pay Uber this transaction ended up costing me approximately $120 extra dollars, I will probably never have electronics delivered from Walmart in the future."
I love this TV so much. It was an upgrade from a 32inch ONN Roku TV. This is a Hisense Roku TV. 58 inches. The 4K is amazing and I have a Roku sound bar connected. I don't believe I need it but I have it anyway. Really easy to set up and I'm very happy with this purchase.
"I purchased this Tv as a gift for my husband. It was delivered within 3 days Perfect (NOT)! The box was a little damaged and we didn't think anything of it since its supposed to be protected inside. He set the whole tv up and when he turned it on the screen was damaged. OK so I immediately called customer service and got a replacement easy enough SO I THOUGHT! The guy told me ill get a replacement the next day DIDNT HAPPEN! So Walmart App showed I would be receiving it on Wednesday NEVER CAME I called Walmart Customer Service and his ONLY explanation was to wait to receive an email 24/48 hrs, but couldn't explain to me what the email was for or when I will be receiving my replacement They actually waited until they received the damaged tv to send me another tv ONE WEEK LATER! OK got the new tv box was damaged again and this time the WHOLE SCREEN WAS SHATTERED LIKE WTH THIS CANT BE HAPPENING! Called again said the same thing again they'll replace it but I asked can I return in store and the lady had the nerve to keep me on hold for 18 minutes so I hung up and requested a full refund! NEVER WILL I ORDER FROM WALMART.COM!"
"I dislike how my package was delivered to me. I disliked how my tv screen is completely destroyed. I dislike that I was charger a fee for the tv mounting service after I wasn’t able to even get my tv mounted. 


Fist I can home to my tv in a damaged box with two holes in it, then I carefully unopened the box with my tv in it, only to find the screen is completely broken. I am extremely unsatisfied with my order."
"At first I think it was a scam ordering the tv online, took me 3 order before I get my TV  and it was in great condition thank god.  Still working great, Walmart customer service I’ll give them a 4 out of 5 really was helpful to fine out what really went wrong with the tv, anyone ordering tv just have to be patient with Walmart"
"Can’t add common channels like Hulu, Prime TV, not even the Roku channel…. And Live streaming channels, forget it. Seriously just get another brand like TLC, because this TV is horrible with the channels selection, the only channel you can add that’s a reconocible channel is Netflix. The control has the “Hulu” button but nothing, this tv doesn’t have Hulu or Prime TV, paramount, HBO or anything….. this tv is not even close to a smart tv…. Just horrible and a waste of money. Your only option is to get your phone and air cast to your tv, but the. Why call this tv a smart tv?"
"super disappointing I do not recommend it at all, the tv screen arrived broken the tv in very bad condition, nobody delivered it to me personally, i found the tv outside the house"
"Quick shipping, nothing broken, instructions clear, good quality, pretty happy w purchase. Will be hiding cords, and mounting my Xbox behind the tv here shortly."
The TV stated it comes with a voice remote. It did not come with a voice remote. I had the TV installed now do I have to pay someone to take it down to return it to get a voice remote?
"Great TV. Simple setup.The screen is UHD. The settings allow personal features and  preferences, like Zoom, Vivid, Contrast, and Brightness. It has 4 HMDI Ports. Main screen can have all the main apps.  I use my Fire TV most of the time. There're also functions like Sleep and Wake."
"I recently bought this early BlackFriday special from Walmart for $298 price drop special. Now, I know why they have it on sale.. they're defective!
First one - when turn on, only has left and red patchy lines.  No damage on the visible screen and I was very careful when handling it, touching on the side protected areas.  I didn't want to remove the protective screen since it won't display well. Ok, then return it for exchange.  Second one, same problem, only show the wavvy lines from top but at least you can see the HiSense Roku word on top. that's it.  Also another defective screen. I've checked for any signs physical damage.. nothing but something internally has gone bad. Call HiSense tech for help.. they said try this, try that, change batteries... told them the screen is bad. Shown them the pic.. they said.. up it's defective. keft it for couple of hours, trying to adjust screen.. didn't help at all.  Hisense really need to check their quality when they ship this out to store.  Both of them have to go back to Walmart again.. another 1 hour roundtrip drive.  What a waste of time. I bought Hisense TV before, my old 42"" from 2019 works great but July/August 2022 products from the factories are really bad!"
I am currently looking at this tv while I write this. And for the price I paid (not on sale) I think it was totally worth it. This tv has a great picture! With several options to adjust the picture further. Although on default settings it already looks. The audio is decent. And sounds loud enough. Although I am using it in my smaller bedroom. So volume level may sound different in your living room. Attached picture does not do justice to actual tv. It's much better in person
"1st, the price for this 58"" great bargain. My wife bought one last year and I bought another one last month. I'm not disappointed. It picked up on my wifi, I can apps easily, but my only regret is the remote....I dont like the fact that there's no numbers to change channels. You literally have only the scoll options, which is the only flaw."
it's not LED full array... it's EDGE LIT.
Thin black horizontal lines across the screen start to appear after seven months of purchase and increasing.
"Love the price of this tv. Easy to use. Build in roku. 
Nice and light. Easy to hang, just need to hide the cord in future."
"Hey everyone! Alright so i looked at the reviews, and was super skeptical but i just got my tv the sound is LOUDDDD so i keep it between 14 %26 18 unless i'm gaming (great for gaming btw) but it's really an amazing tv glad it was on sale when i got it. i would 100% recommend. also great for blasting music while i'm cleaning no surround system even required unless you want some extra pizzazz lol"
"Tv worked fine for 10 months.  Turned it on this morning and sounds is fine, but picture is very very dark."
"First time buying a tv brand new. Surprised at how effortless the purchase, delivery and condition of the TV. It connected to all my devices w/minimal effort."
"Ordered the tv for pickup because I didn't want anybody to mishandle it, just to get home and find that the tv was broken! I only selected one star because it was required to do so."
I purchased this item and it arrived shattered. They made it more difficult to get it replaced and or issue a refund. I was back and forth trying to explain myself for over an hour just to get a replacement or refund.
Great smart TV easy to set up and operate lot of apps available they are endless I was very surprised and the quality of this TV at this price point the way the TV is laid out and how easy it is to you with the Roko System there are a lot a free TV options and movies as long as you have Wi-Fi available you don’t even really need to have cable Wi-Fi it’s not required however but the smart part of the TV will not operate without it it’s got a great screen with great colors in the picture in my opinion there are better pictures with more pixels on higher resolution screens but for the price point that I paid I got a great deal on this TV and I’m glad I made the purchase I highly recommend for you to consider that’s TV the 58 inch Hisense One of the things I do like about this the mount for the feet have two different locations were you can mount them so if you have a large 65 or 70 inch desk you can put the feet wide if you don’t have the room and only have a the small desk the feet other size it 20 inches apart from side to side so you only need a desk thank is a little longer than 20 inches and you can put up your 58 inch tv Which is nice if you’re in a tight spot but one nice TV especially at a decent price
"When I purchased the hisense I was sceptical about it. When I received it, which was 4 days prior to what was said. It has a great picture, excellent brightness and dark. Excellent stereo sound speaker. The only thing was that the factory volume was set so high on it. That when I got it all set up and the volume came on I almost  jumped out of my skin. Lol"
Affordable TV that haves all the bells and whistles you like to have on a TV set. Picture quality is ok and black colors are a bit washout. Apps and Roku is where it shines and the remote is simple and fast to use. My friend thinks i spend a lot on my TV..
"This TV is awesome! I thought I'd have to buy a sound bar but the sound system is great! I read the other reviews concerning FedEx that were negative. If you're buying this TV online, just have it sent to the store for pickup. FedEx is HORRIBLE! It took them over a week to deliver my TV when it was supposed to take 2 days!  But I was certainly pleased when it arrived. Love it!"
"I am in love with this tv.  I had a 50"" before so I wasnt expecting this tv to seem so much larger.  But it is huge.  The picture on it is so clear.  This is my first smart tv so all the extra free channels have been fun to explore.  We only use an antenna for live tv and we were even able to pick up channels we didnt get before with our other tv.  I definitely have recommended it to friends and family."
"My mother's TV died on her after six years of purchasing it it was a flat screen 50 inch Vizio TV it did not have 4K.  For my Birthday in  2019 I got myself a Hisense 60 inch 4K HDR TV I am very happy with my TV and I got it from Walmart When I went to look for a new TV for my mother I saw they did not have the 60-in that I bought last time but they had a 58-in 2 in does not matter so I purchase it. She loves this TV she is very, very happy with it and that makes me happy."
"I dont use the stock speakers as I have separate ones I plug in. I did notice when going from my gaming system (old school NES using a HDMI AV adapter) to regular TV, the volume gets a bit messed up so I have to restart the TV.  The stand is a bit flimsy for a tv this size. They could of made that a bit sturdier. Overall though I am happy with my purchase. This was purchased as a secondary TV, but I would buy it again. Just make sure to do pick up in store. FedEX is the delivery company and the first one they sent was completely shattered."
I was looking for a gift for my husband and I was drawn to the TV when I seen the apps and the price for $298.00 I said I’m getting that and I am so grateful  that I did the TV is worth money it has Cable Channel and high volume capacity and a lot of apps!!! Lord God I thank you for another blessing
"If you can save a little more and prefer a True 4K natural looking image go with the 65inch, much better picture. This one also freezes a bit at time and I have had it for about two weeks, not saying it’s a terrible buy but for me to bring it all the way home and go by images I saw online i have to give it a 3 star but other than that. This is an excellent tv for those who are not so much into detail and technology. I’m quite critical so if u are too then I would say wait a bit and get the 65inch which I also have"
"First one arrived with broken screen. I thought for sure this shipping problem would have been fixed by now but nope! A second one arrived. Easy set up but doesnt seem very bright on brightest setting! And corners appear darker.  The screen isnt broken the second time but I may have to return it cause the brightness isnt bright enough. This is a nice sized tv but very cheaply made. As an older women, I was able to get it out of the box and standing all on my own easily. Very light. I am wondering just how long this tv will last. If there is an option, I will come back in 6 months and let you know if its still working well."
"I love this TV. It is a great size and the volume Level was so good I didn't even have to connect my sound bar. I wish it was Bluetooth, but I still love it. Its lightweight and it handles my streaming accounts like Netflix, Hulu, prime, Disney, and sling very well. My family is very satisfied with it."
"We really like this TV. We purchased it for my son's bedroom and he's thrilled. It looks really big. The quality of the image is very crisp and clear, beautiful colors, and the sound is also really good. So far we love it. We would probably buy another one."
"Overall it is a nice TV. But take a good, hard look at the remote control included with it. There are no number buttons for quick access to your favorite. Instead, the manufacturer thinks you have a lot of extra time on your hands to slowly scroll, one channel at a time, through 1100 or more channels. Not to mention how boring and frustrating that is. The little remote that comes with it is not intuitive at all. I have concluded it was designed without human testing. To me, this ruins the whole TV experience, and I am thinking of sending it back!!!"
TV is at a great price for the quality. Picture and sound are great. I bought it to replace and older smart tv that didn’t have the mirroring affect built in. The only complaint I have is it does not want to detect my HDMI connections. Tried connecting my DVD player and none of the 3 HDMI ports work.
I am not a television expert however this is a great TV. Picture is good sound is good my only complaint is I can't get Amazon Alexa to turn it on automatically it stalls and then I have to do it manually. I have to figure that part out. Otherwise I'm extremely happy with the television.
"The tv itself has great picture with different settings to choose from. Audio is perfect for us along with settings for it too.
Love the Roku already installed along with Roku app function available, which is a reason we chose this tv. Love having the 58in screen... its perfect for our living room."
"Nice television.  Does the job.  Great price.  Received late for the following reason:  The package was damaged.  Looked like something crushed the package.  The delivery company said they performed an inspection and passed.  I would like some assurance that, if there is problem in the future, Walmart will take care of the situation.  Thank you."
Thank you very much was perfect having it delivered helps a lot specially when you don’t have access to a big car I appreciate it very much
The TV was broken and when I returned it online they told me I had time until the beginning of May and when I returned it to them they told me it was too late and we are now in the middle of April
The TV has a slight angle/lean to the back. It’s very light weight and is a cheap option for a 4k TV
Purchased it once after a month the screen messed up. Went to exchange it for the same one that one lasted about 7 months
"It got a little bit delayed but just by one day so its fine. The TV is really good overall, good quality and all the perks and all for just $298!"
I love everything about my t.v I'm actually gonna buy a even bigger one great quality an beyond reasonable price.
very good quality really high def this one wasn't broken when I bought it from the store great picture
This is the best TV I've ever owned! Better than the Samsung I had previously. The Roku adds-on additional features I like too.
"soon as we pulled it out the box n plugged it in n the tv was broke.. n i got it on the black Friday sale n they have no more, im so disappointed n hurt"
I bought this TV on sale and it was in the box until two weeks ago. Last night  I turned on the tv and and there was a black vertical line in the middle.
Tv screen was shattered when we got it out of the box. Had to return it for a refund. The box was in tact all except the bottom corner on one side. Damaged boxes should not be sold.
"It worked great for a while with split screen coming on and all i had to do was restart it but now thats not working and i xant find any solution to fix it, now its stuck like this."
This 58” TV for $278 is a great value. The picture quality and it’s simplicity is a great bargain. It isn’t as nice as my Samsung tv’s but larger than the 32”TCL it replaced. I’m enjoying it on my ps4.
My tv was broken upon arrival .. very disappointed
I love everything about this television! It is sleeve and it is huge. It's perfect.
Don't waste your money! After 2 months of used this what turned out.
I loved how they delivered within 13 hours . I just don't like the tv. Slow booting up .
Excellent quality for the price!

Fantastic deal and great tv
I arrive without the legs or base to place it on the table
Love this tv it's perfect
came broken !!! mounted it and everything just to take plastic off and seen broken!
Love this TV for the space I needed it for.
I literally just took the tv out of the box and the screen is cracked and messed up
"bought at Walmart in spring 2021 about 8 months ago. haven't had any problems!  sorry for the few who have had issues, But under no circumstances is this a 1 star TV and it's a shame that people provide misleading reviews because they had a truly unfortunate experience.  Electronics have lemons, but a few lemons don't mean irs crap.   Hisense is putting out great products at affordable prices.  I looked at the TCL and others all side by side and the brightness and color saturation are great. Roku system works flawlessly."
"So very happy with my new 58"" Smart tv! Does much more than I ever expected. My hard earned money well spent!🩷😁👍"
its larger than i expected for a 58 inch and its super loud i love it and it goes perfect in my new place.
"we love the size of the picture. The price was really really good and competitive to other brands of this size. Roku, enabled and 4k!"
Only had this for a few months and black screen
The audio is not working. Tried troubleshooting but there is still no sound.
Exactly what I wanted no issues great price and for a good tv.
The price and excellent picture
When we opened the tv box and turned the tv on the screen was broken
"Great picture quality, easy setup, lots of streaming apps."
"Great value!
58"" Roku, $298, delivered."
the quality and price is perfect.  i love my tv
Nice picture. Great size and price. Good sound with a sound bar too
There are lines in the right corner from top to bottom
"Excellent quality TV price, on sale $268."
Very good deal! Clean and clear picture. Volume is clear also! No problems!
I love the TV. No complaints
Very slim it's has all the apps that you would need
Love the TV everything was seamless and setup was fast ! Colors are very vibrant !
Fantastic buy. You get a lot for the money.
"I had to go get another tv it was broken
 But the new one I got from the store was good"
This a great tv for a great price.. good quality.. and nice size
it came broke so waste of money
Very clear and beautiful picture. Easy to setup and delivered free the next day‼️
Love the TV but hate the Roku. It keeps going in and out. I hooked my firestick up to it and love it.
"like everyone else, arrived damaged. huge crack on the lower right hand corner. super annoying to have to return"
Great picture! Great size! Best TV I have ever purchased.
I loved everything about this order.
Tv doesn't last 30 days video doesn't play only sound green screen
Screen damaged cracked when we plugged after taking out of box today
Love my New 58 in TV in My Room
This is an awesome purchase. Worth every single penny
Tv was broken when I plugged it in
For some odd reasons it just stopped working after 2 weeks. Red light will not come on
Great size great picture great price
Fits perfectly on the stand that was given to me. Helps with family times
I like my Roku tv. It's easy to operate.
clear picture vivid colors
Delivery was delayed due to COVID but I got it two days after sooo worth it for the price very nice size looks just like a 60in cant even notice the difference.. Picture is soo clear clean and crisp
"I bought the tv for my 12 year old son. He is legally blind so he really likes it. It is easier to see than his old tv.  He doesn't have to sit as close. The color is a bit off to me, but he says it isn't to him."
delivered exactly on time.  the walmart delivery does not set up.  but delivery was prompt and good.  television very easy set up and easy to load my preferences.  good picture n sound.
"This is my 5th Hisense Smart Tv. I highly recommend Hisense, a great TV for the money and easy to operate. Highly recommend the Hisense Sound bar to pair with the Tv."
My TV is broken.
Love it
I waited all day for a pick up order just to be notified I have to have it shipped! I'm highly disappointed! I opted to pick up because my first tv was delivered damaged I expected better from wal mart
"I brought a 58 inch's Hisense Roku tv and fed x dropped it off today 11-30-2022 around 2:30,the box can all broken up and the tv it self is busted,cracks all over the tv Some deal I got now I have to take it back tomorrow,wish me luck"
Loved the  Roku TV but the wireless quit working after 37 days (only ran a total of 8hrs in those 37 days) and Walmart only allows returns for up to 30 days. I'd think the wireless on smart TV should work longer than 37 days... Very Disappointing! My other Roku Tvs have been great; not so sure about the Hisense brand.
"I returned the one we bought. Sure, the price was right, and we liked the Roku features and the simple remote.  But the picture (at least on ours) was dim overall, even at the brightest setting. Black uniformity was awful, and flashlighting around the edges and corners was pronounced and distracting. (Look those two things up. They matter. Also, see the photo. That actual picture is equally blue, edge to edge.) The viewing angle was also very narrow, with the picture veering toward gray as you move away from straight-on. I'm giving it two stars because it's not a complete fail. But for me it wasn't worth keeping."
"Bought this model last year and was a great option that fitted our needs.  I used to buy big brand TVs, but after issues with Samsung, LG and Sony that ended up in a dumpster we decided to get this Hisense.  When we got tired of looking at an unusable TV that extended warranty decided to not fix I told my son lets go to WM and get the biggest and cheapest TV.  This model made the cut as after tax it was 310 bucks.  Declined extended warranty as for this price I could just get another one and not deal with the hassle of extended warranty companies.  We are happy we did.  The Hisense looks good and has all the new technology that big brands have.  BTW we did read the reviews at the store and almost if not all of them were for shipping issues with the panels.  Hence the reason for getting it at the store and not shipped to our home.  Excellent TV for the price.  No disappointment here.  Still standing strong after a year.  Hope this helps to anyone out there trying to save some Moolah.  Hisense will fit the bill for daily and movie night watching with family and friends."
Great Tv for the price picture is clear great sound without my sound bar
No issues.  I'm use to roku tv from China and so far no issues.  Good size.
Amazing tv! This tv is huge. Picture and sound are great and I am so impressed. BUY IT
I love the value of this tv! It's HUGE! It's cheap! It has a great picture! Easy to control
Took the tv out the box to put it up on the mount screen was cracked
Love the TV one of my favourite TV
Great price and picture is perfect. Very happy with this tv!
I like how I ordered the tv on Thursday and it was delivered the next day.
Looks nice and fit in the area I needed it. Perfect fit.
The tv screen arrived damaged.
The picture and sound quality is amazing. Easy to connect to Wi-Fi and Cable is to connect.
"Glitches sometimes, not the best quality"
It was a late delivery but well worth the wait
The screen is damaged. I returned the TV and I still wait the refund !
The tv was broke when it came out the box
When I open my tv it was broken
i purchased it march 2022 order number 3402224-655774 and it died dec 26 2022
My tv literally just blowed randomly. Be careful
I love it 🥰
boughy this and was shipped a damage item. it even had the damage sticker where the previous person returned it damaged.
System was broken.  The screen was seriously cracked.  Two stars because of the return policy.  That was good.
Had the tv 2 weeks and brightness going out already. Checked tv settings and everything was fine. But tv still showing like this.
"Tv showed up to my house with the screen cracked in multiple places. The return process was very easy, but still disappointing that the tv arrived to me in this condition."
In 7months the tv broke
The picture is terrible

Driver was Great !
I have the 58 inch I brought about 6 months ago. I was watching tv n the whole tv went black I've called n no one responded are anything still waiting it's a shame people spend their money and the company doesn't try to help you this is my first time buying this brand
Broke after 4 monthsj
"I don't know how there's so many people leaving a negative review for this tv?! It works great! I got this to replace a 55” that my autistic son broke and it works great! Got all the apps in unlike someone else said. Hulu, Roku, Disney , HBOMax, Discovery  ,AmazonPrime,etc, maybe the other reviewers don't know what they're doing 🤷🏼‍♀️ I would buy another one if needed and also a smaller for my bedroom! First photo blurry cause of movement of my iPad ihave unstady hands🤦🏼‍♀️"
"It said it was a 58in tv but when I measured it , it was a 51in tv."
Screen is cracked
My order did come on time and when I did receive it the box was damaged as well as the tv I was very upset
Had this tv since September 18 2022 not even a yr and it went screen turned black and won't power on I will not be riding another one I'm not understanding how these Walmart tvs just go
Nice TV but may have been defective from factory.  But things like this happens.  Will reach out to Walmart for possible replacement.  But besides that great TV.
"We purchased this TV from Walmart and left it upright in our vehicle and carefully drove it home. We CAREFULLY unboxed it, according to the directions, and set it up and plugged it in. It had a huge crack and black spot in the top right corner. So we boxed it back up and went back to Walmart to exchange it. Got the other TV home and  set it up, even more carefully than the first time. Everything seemed fine but 2 weeks later, we turned it on and there's a huge line all the way across the screen and the picture below the line is all messed up. 

There's clearly a defect that the manufacturer needs to fix and they should be refunding all of their customers."
"I love Hisense brand, but I don't like Roku because it's a lot slower than the fire stick from Amazon. This particular tv doesn't show Hi definition like my previous Hisense it may just be because I don't have internet connection hooked up to it yet and I'm watching live television through antenna on my internet comes on Saturday I will know more"
"Just over one year old and trash!
Lines started showing up at the bottom of the screen, then about a month later it overtook the screen and became inoperable. Of course they only have a one year warranty and we’re stuck with a bad TV. 
$338 for a years use!"
This is the best tv . The pictures are amazing and high definition it has the ability to keep up with the movie and the newer moves can make me little woozy. Surround sound can be adjusted. But out of the box my cats was following the noise above confused nothing came. Lol
"I want to tell you about my 58 inch TV that was mounted on my wall think before you order if you want it mounted on your wall you’re gonna have to search for the right people because the prices are all over the place for mounting. The TV is great no problems beautiful picture, it is seems much bigger than a 55 inch TV. I recommend getting the mounting that you can pull out from the wall and then re-angle so that you can put it in different angles to watch. The price was great for this TV through Walmart Cain quickly was very pleased no damage Notified me when it got here so it didn’t sit outside for someone to steal. Good luck all."
"Let me start by saying the picture was good quality for about 1 year and 3 months. Then all of a sudden I'm getting vertical and horizontal lines and the screen goes completely black. 

I have NEVER moved my tv since it came out of the box so I know it's a manufacturer defect. Sent all the info to Hisense and they wouldn't help me because it's been a year. No credit or anything. I won't ever buy this tv again. I have TV's 10 years old that still work without a problem."
"I purchased this TV three months ago. A few days ago, I noticed a change in the pixels at the top of the television, the next day there was a line of red down the middle of my TV. I reached out to the Hisense customer service and filed a claim. They told me that this is this is “considered an accidental and physical damage, which is not covered under our manufacturer's warranty, as such, unable to repair any parts of this unit”. My TV did not throw itself off of the TV stand, my TV did not go for a walk and injure itself… My TV has been sitting there, minding its own business and this is a defect in this equipment. Don’t take a chance with these televisions because customer support and service won’t be there for you if you have any problems."
"I have had this tv since February 2022
It was delivered here in one day!!
I love the remote so easy to operate.
I never look at the buttons!
It has a great help section and a breeze to connect to WiFi!! Gotta say I have never watched so much tv as I do now!!
Just moved and carried it in my backseat it arrived in perfect condition and still working great!! I'm getting another for my new home!!"
"My Hisense Roku Smart TV keeps resetting to the Home Screen in the middle of movies. At first I thought it was a WiFi issue, but my 75” Oon doesn't do this. Also, the first time I plugged my fire stick into my Hisense it displayed normal, but since after I powered my Hisense on daily the fire stick displays only in a very small App and I'm unable to enlarge the display. Therefore, I'm unable to use my fire stick remote to enjoy.  I'm also an Amazon Prime member, and it keeps resetting to the Home Screen while I'm watch watching a movie. I would like to exchange my item."
This tv is broken
They sent me a broke tv
"I got this TV because it was a bargain for its size. I was concerned about the quality of the screen, but it actually has a beautiful, crystal clear picture with even lighting across the entire width. There are no dark or bright lines or spots at the edges as is sometimes the case with budget smart tvs.

The Roku interface and remote were as expected based on having used a dedicated Roku device before. It was easy to add apps or remove them and I was able to both connect an antenna for local TV and play my own video files off of a thumb drive without problems using the built-in software. It was one of the easier to use smart TVs.

The TV was easy to set up and assembled (just screw on two legs and plug in the power). It's not overly heavy, but it also doesn't feel flimsy. I considered this excellenty value for such a large screened TV."
Big bang for the buck!!! I've purchased a couple of dozen of Hisense TV's. I use them in both our AirBnB's and our personal residence. Never had an issue. How Hisense is kicking out these great smart TV's cheaper than my iPhone is a mystery. Maybe Apple should have Hisense make the iPhone.
"I was excited to get a new and bigger TV, so when we hooked this one up I was so very unhappy.  The sound was so loud when an action shot or suspenseful part, that it blasted us out of our livingroom.  We even bought a sound bar and it is still way too loud.  My husband and I are 74 and 80 years old and this is horrid.  I was told that Roku TVs were used for playing games etc. and there is nothing I can do. We have gone through the settings and NOTHING tones down the sound"
"Mine was used, as confirmed by the fact that the Utube search had been filled with ten previous searches.  I called the customer service for the manufacturer, and confirmed that the state of the set indicated that someone had to have used it previously.  
I am returning the set; not sure if I want to try another, or just get one from somewhere else!"
"I liked that it's bigger than I thought. Great picture and sound. Allows cable and roku. And can remane options to what you want. 

I don't like that my sound bar will not connect to TV. No matter what I do. It has no sound coming on. On hdmi e arc. Will on hdmi. But low and no air cord option.  Doesn't work on head phones either."
"Good product, but bad customer service from Walmart. Tv arrived damaged on May 23rd. It took almost 3 weeks and hours on the phone for Walmart to figure out how to schedule a FedEx pickup in my remote area. Still waiting on my refund to this date. Walmart has a terrible return process for damaged tv's."
"I bought this Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED LCD Roku Smart TV to replace another set that did not make it 2 years. Lost the picture. The LED tubes went. Can't find a replacement part for that model. So I bought the extended warranty for the Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED LCD Roku Smart TV. Also checked. Replacement parts are available. For now. 

The Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED LCD Roku Smart TV is a ROKO smart TV. Before I had a Google Prime TV. Set up is a little different, but not much difference. The standard remote the TV comes with does not have voice, that I used to searching on the Google TV. I downloaded the ROKO app on my phone so when I want to search something I use the app on the phone which also performs all the other remote commands. 
The Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED LCD Roku Smart TV has a good picture, good sound. Only problem is all the set up choices you choose on the initial set up and there is no way to go back and change them. Unless you try the RESET to FACTORY. Which I don't have time to fool with. I have sound set to Theater, which of course, can't hear the voices, and when action and music kick in people a block away can hear it. Maybe should have chose the voice option. 
I really don't use equipment to connect to the TV. Too many choices online to fool around with DVD and such. So I have not tried them. 
Overall I am pleased so far. Can't wait for football season to start. 
Just 4 stars based on the fact I suppose there are better 5 star TVs out there at twice the price."
Bought this Tv June 22 of 2022.. by October the screen would be white when I turned it on but it would only last for 2 minutes or so. Now it is April first (hasn't even been a year yet) and the tv only shows a white screen. It was great while it lasted but wouldn't recommend
"Good picture quality . Sound is great, only thing I noticed is that the volume fluctuates significantly amongst transitions to different shows and commercials being played. No big deal though. Roku is my go to. I love the free remote app, super convenient, esp if you have kids in the house that carry off the remote! I have 3 Hisense Roku tvs. Reliable!"
"I had not even had this tv in my living room for 1 year before the screen just goes BLACK and no buttons,  resets, etc can fix it. It is a shame that I already have to spend more money to replace this tv in under a year. I guess I will try another brand. 😔"
I really like this tv got this tv on sale for under 300.00 and had it delivered by a driver since I have Walmart plus. It is a good tv and the picture is so clear and it's the perfect size for my living room I wasn't looking for over the top tv I don't care about that stuff I basically wanted to a good tv that was a Roku tv so I could I watch my shows and regular tv this fits the bill and a nice cheap bill at that.
"This television worked well for the 1st two years. Now the picture is dark around the edges, it makes a buzzing sound and cuts off periodically. I'm glad I purchased insurance."
I have purchased several Hisense Roku TVs from Walmart. Awful! These Tvs will not last the past 2 years. They all eventually developed a black screen with streaks in the background.
"I already own the 58R6E, which I also gave a 5 star review. I was bummed I got the last one because I needed another for my bedroom. Then the R6E3 was released and I ordered it immediately. I canât believe the picture quality at such a low price. Iâm beyond happy with both TVs!"
"Let me start by saying the picture was good quality for about 1 year and 3 months. Then all of a sudden I'm getting vertical and horizontal lines and the screen goes completely black. 

I have NEVER moved my tv since it came out of the box so I know it's a manufacturer defect. Sent all the info to Hisense and they wouldn't help me because it's been a year. No credit or anything. I won't ever buy this tv again. I have TV's 10 years old that still work without a problem."
"I purchased this TV three months ago. A few days ago, I noticed a change in the pixels at the top of the television, the next day there was a line of red down the middle of my TV. I reached out to the Hisense customer service and filed a claim. They told me that this is this is “considered an accidental and physical damage, which is not covered under our manufacturer's warranty, as such, unable to repair any parts of this unit”. My TV did not throw itself off of the TV stand, my TV did not go for a walk and injure itself… My TV has been sitting there, minding its own business and this is a defect in this equipment. Don’t take a chance with these televisions because customer support and service won’t be there for you if you have any problems."
"I have had this tv since February 2022
It was delivered here in one day!!
I love the remote so easy to operate.
I never look at the buttons!
It has a great help section and a breeze to connect to WiFi!! Gotta say I have never watched so much tv as I do now!!
Just moved and carried it in my backseat it arrived in perfect condition and still working great!! I'm getting another for my new home!!"
"My Hisense Roku Smart TV keeps resetting to the Home Screen in the middle of movies. At first I thought it was a WiFi issue, but my 75” Oon doesn't do this. Also, the first time I plugged my fire stick into my Hisense it displayed normal, but since after I powered my Hisense on daily the fire stick displays only in a very small App and I'm unable to enlarge the display. Therefore, I'm unable to use my fire stick remote to enjoy.  I'm also an Amazon Prime member, and it keeps resetting to the Home Screen while I'm watch watching a movie. I would like to exchange my item."
This tv is broken
They sent me a broke tv

"When comparing this side by side to a TCL 425 watching a 4K HDR movie (Bad Boys For Life), the 58R6E3 looks and sounds better to me. The HiSense has a little more backlight bleed, but it isn't unbearable. I am no videofile or audiofile, but I haven't seen any indepth reviews on this HiSense TV yet. Having said that, this is my second R6E in a month. The first one developed lines in the screen after a week. I returned that one and got the 4 year extended warranty on this one. Is it as good as the $600-$1000 TV's? I'm sure it's not. But for a budget tv it seems just fine. The software doesn't lag, it gets brighter than the TCL 4 series, and it sounds better too."
T.V burned out within 9 months screen just went black but power light is still lit and reacts to buttons on the remote just the screen is gone!! Called hisense for warranty you better hold on to the receipt they are completely useless!! Buyer beware its not worth saving a few bucks because you'll be buying another one before a years up!!! Tv is on in the photo literally garbage tv dont buy!!
I screen had com loose from the back panel. I was told to return it back too FedEx I did the next day. Then I was told I could put another one at the Walmart store. Well I was there at the pick up time. The TV had not been picked they could not find the order. So I canceled this one too reorder another one. So now it was more money down. The TV was nice but my Walmart experience I was not happy with. Maybe I'll order one later if the price is the same.
"I was looking for a tv for my room and ,we found this 58 inch 4k hisense smart tv ,and the resolutión ,image,sound are awesome for me it was easy for me to sync my movie apps in the tv, I realle love it ,its  our Early Christmas present for me and my hubby."
"I bought the R63G 50 inch model in june 2022, having it over 6 months. I can easily say it has amazing Colors and brightness. Display's a sign for couple of second indicating dolby vision HDR is active when playing xbox Series x with games that support it. RE2 remake and RE3 remake with this VA panel and Dolby Vision HDR is a treat to your eyes. Only downfall is this TV does not have VVR refresh rate so some my pc games like death stranding has to be played in locked 4k medium to high 60fps, rather then 4k 50 to 55 fps ultra based on rt 6650 xt graphic card. Small complain, but picture and display is sharp with amazing HDR brightness. Roku Os is the way to go with amazing TV remote. 10/10."
"Buyer beware! 
Tv worked fine for 13 months and then the screen started having white and pastel lines and cloudy. Luckily, I purchased the extended  warranty. 
However, I'm still waiting for a refund they promised less the extra $55 dollars I paid for the warranty.  I'll edit if it arrives."
"I loved the very reasonable price, this tv is a lot of bang for your buck. It is a relatively easy thing to set up and operate, in addition to the Roku functions I also have a gaming pc setup that really pops on the 4K setting. Just add a soundbar and you are good to go for a very competitive viewing experience."
"Seriously, don't. This review is actually zero stars. After only two weeks of owning this TV, a horizontal strip the whole length of the TV has gone out. This happened to my old TV...after 10 years!! What a waste of money! Now we have to deal with returning this piece of junk with Walmart's reduced hours or go without a TV while we send it back! Completely unacceptable. Don't throw your money away on this very low quality TV."
"I went to Walmart not really trying to buy nothing but groceries but I noticed a young lady going out to her car with a 58 inch Hisense Roku Smart TV and a Walmart associate helping her to her car. So i asked the young lady how much she pay for it and she told me $279.00 but the associate told me
$300 out the door! And I thought wowwww thats a good deal and sure enough I went inside and it was exactly what they told me and one left so i was going to put it in layaway but they were closed so I went ahead and bought it. It is now September 8th and I just opened it and seen this ! Its cracked and not showing a picture. Fresh out the box and I see this ! So disappointed because I needed a tv now back to watching nothing. Good its only been 3 days and its still under warranty. Taking it back to the store hopefully they have another in stock.    Very disappointing. If I could rate it no stars I would choose that option."
"DONT DONT BUY THIS TV…
I’m actually writing the BBB today WALMART will not stand by this piece of JUNK years time it will start flashing the power light and never come back on…TRUST ME ITS NOT JUST ME… this TV should be recalled me and three friends have these as they were $255.00 in Maryland we got the around the same time they have all done the same thing…we literally all have only had them about 15 months then they went wacky…"
"So this was a great buy, it was cheap, it was a replacement monitor for my current computer desk monitor that went from 32 inch to 58 in. Also can be used for TV, news, comes with Roku and all the new streaming app features hulu/netflix etc. I plan to just replace my old 1st gen tv/cable with this box as an all in one. 1 item, this came with damaged packaging and 1 pixel area that stands out as faulty you can tell as it powers down, but it's not noticeable during use. I was able to finance with affirm over 12 months so its perfect for me as a replacement that i can pay over time."
Gave this to my daughter as a gift. Opened the box and set it up. We realized that the bottom corner of the screen was pushed in causing circular black shadows. Box was in perfect condition with no damage. Hisense took no responsibility! Thank god Walmart is making this right. In my opinion this had to have been damaged before packaging. If not then their packaging is not protective enough for shipping because the box arrived in perfect condition. Will be the last product I purchase in this brand.
Tv is absolutely beautiful. Perfect size! Unfortunately ours came broken and the only option was to return for refund and not exchange. There was a large puncture in the screen on the far left side. We’d purchased it on Black Friday Deals and were so excited.
Waited a week all for my tv to show up shattered. Very disappointing.
The screen is broken and the cartoon is damaged also.
description said tv was 58 inches this tv is barely 50 inches very upset and disappointed
They just delivered my TV and the screen is busted how do I return it for another one thank you
This is a great tv. It has a beautiful crystal clear picture. You won't regret this purchase!
For the price Im very pleased
"This tv is bigger and clarity is great. The set up was easy and very clear, so far so good five ⭐️"
I have brought this tv back twice in 30days the screen is green and colored bars show up there is sound but no picture and you can click on the apps and turn the tv and see the apps just fine but when you try and watch anything the screen is green and Walmart won't even refund or exchange it for a third time I'm done with walmart
"we bought this tv on rollback and saved about $100 , its definitely better than any of the other tvs ive owned. definitely makes family movie night more  enjoyable and exciting. dont sleep on hisense theyre just as good of not better than youre bigger brand names."
"This was a perfect transaction from the ordering all the way to receiving my TV.  

I saw it, I reviewed it, I ordered it thru the Walmart App and it was delivered to my door the next morning.   The driver was so nice and helpful that I immediately went in and doubled the tip I had previously added to the order.

The TV itself was like ""Plug %26 Play.  It has an excellent picture and th3 size 58, well I think it was right on the mark for my living room.  I went back and forth myself on which TV. Brand, the size 55 - 60- 65-??   Hey I didn't hesitate once I came across this 58"" Hisence Roku R6 seri3s.  I settled on this 58 because they are both, Hisence %26 Roku good brands that have proven themselves many times over in my life.  I am very pleased with this Television and highly favor it over the others.  I believe you will be extremely happy as I am with the Hisense Roku Television."
"Very nice picture, large screen, but the off-gassing was overwhelming and scary. I ran an air-purifier, which I think helped some, but the off-gassing was still pretty strong a week later and only slightly dissipated.  I didn't want to keep breathing it."
"This Hisense 58 inch 4K Roku tv is absolutely fantastic. The picture quality is amazing and there's hardly a frame so the picture is almost right to the edges. It also works with my Alexa devise so I can do movie searches without even picking up the remote. Seriously, this thing is awesome."
"The RokuTV worked perfectly as soon as it was attached to our Direct TV box and the Amazon Firestick was attached. Took a little searching on Google to figure how to use the Direct TV Genie to run the controller.

A fantastic buy at $269 for a beautiful 58"" image. Walmart is really doing a great sale on this unit."
I wanted to like this tv but I kept having issues with the sound I had my sound bar connected through the eArc channel and would suddenly cut out the picture was amazing but you cant have a good picture with no sound I didn't want to take another chance on this brand so I got a vizio and problem solved no more sound issues
"This TV is a piece of crap. From the time it came out of the box it will NOT sync the picture and audio on Hulu. I have messed with all of the options on the video and audio. Walmart won't do a thing. Won't buy anymore TVs at Walmart, that's for sure."
"I love this TV. It has a pretty big screen 58"" is perfect for my bedroom. I have never had this brand or heard anything good or bad about them. I love that Walmart delivers to my door as I have a small car and could not pick it up and the sound went out on my other one. So overall I would recommend this TV for sure. I forgot that it is a smart TV with Roku built in which is a plus for sure. It really is a great TV."
Honestly I just want it to make sure my product was fully secured what I mean is making sure the driver something cover it because we do have cameras around the facility but just making sure my product is protected if I'm not happened to be at house for any reason
"Delivery was timely and came with no damage. Setup was quick and easy. Roku operating system very easy to use. Have Blue Ray DVD that upscales 4k, PS4, PS3 connected to 3 HDMI ports all works great. Have Original Xbox and VCR connected to an RED/Yellow/White splitter to single RED/Yellow/White port on back both works great. Speaker volume and sound quality are good plenty load enough quality good (I do not need a sound bar). Picture quality is good (I like) can't complain at price range - adjustments are easy to get to and adjust while watching (real time). Have streaming services and works great wireless connection works great. Also use Tablo for antenna hooked up in another room in house Tablo application and HD Home run apps available on Ruku. Also have straight antenna connected works great and also has pause function that is used with usb drive 16gb min drive size 70 minute pause time will erase is channel switched."
Excellent purchase! It was easy to set up and works great with excellent picture quality. The price is cheap but the quality isn't. Couldn't ask for anything more. I was so happy with my purchase that I bought another to replace an old TV. Definitely worth the money and more.
"The image is adjustable, with edits it became so crisp, the Roku software is so good and convenient that it impressed me. And the TV is so good it improved the quality of the sound experiment, although I've had the surround system for years. The best value for money"
"You can't go wrong with this tv for the price! We purchased it for an additional tv in a spare room and didn't want to spend big money!  Seriously, they could sell this tv for hundreds of dollars more and it would still be a bargain! The picture quality and the color are nice quality, the sound is more than passable, however, I wish that it would be a better quality."
"I wanted to pickup the TV at Kilmarnock.  The order went for delivery automatically and it came as scheduled.  When set up the unit did not work and the screen appeared to be damaged. I returned the unit to Kilmarnock and purchased a unit from stock. This unit appears to be ok, sofar it works great. 
It has been a lot of extra work for a 84 year old man."
Just bought this in March. Today when I turned it on the colors are inverted and nothing I try fixes it. Even factory reset did nothing.
this Tv  is  a  Piece Of  Junk  It  smells Like It is  burning  and  has  lines  Running  back and fouth On it    DO NOT  PURCHASE  !
the picture is amazing without any extra help with 4K box or anything the picture is very clear very nice size for a room around 12x12 perfect
The first one I had delivered to my house and showed up broken so had to take it back off the wall and bring in in to exchange for a different one
amazing tv huge screen easy to set up beautiful picture roku is an awesome operating system good sound i advise going to the store to buy it i have read many reviews saying delivery is a bad idea but unbeatable for the price very glad i bought it
I would love to view shows on this TV but unfortunately it only have color lines that look like a cracked screen. Purchased it for my family room and can’t get a refund because of the timeline
"This high tech large screen 4k TV was available at an unbelievable price of less than $300 for a 58-inch TV... The quality seems great, the picture is wonderful. I put the TV in my garage ""Man cave"" so I could watch it in my hot tub. :-)"
"So an awesome TV. Great picture, great response time. i was avoiding Samsung because i was having issue with the apps and response time. No issues here. Plus the roku and user friendly.  Alsongreat with my PS5. HDR is awesome"
"I love my t.v. the price was very reasonable. I did a price comparison.  It was delivered a day early. The delivery person was kind, competent, and very helpful."
"Great smart TV with terrific picture quality and ROKU to boot, making it so easy for us to dial in HBO plus, Netflix. Hulu and all the rest. Got it in time to watch one of the best Super Bowl games ever at a very reasonable price."
"Absolutely unbelievable, the TV arrived in the trunk of a car with an unstable door. The screen was shattered. Completely, disappointed. A replacement is needed."
"I used to have a 55"" dumb TV with a Fire stick, but this is better. My only complaints are the IR remote instead of Bluetooth and the lack of a voice remote."
"The TV is great . The downside is that we had to purchase an identical TV in just over a year to replace the one we had. Roku and Hisense customer service were no help , pushing responsibility off to each other, and neither company helped us ."
"Of course, I love the price and the Hisense 58"" was very easy to set up, but you really need help to handle a tv this big! It isn't very heavy, just awkward to handle alone. The picture is like ""WOW""! I could not stop looking at it!"
Have had several ofvthis brand TV and this 58in is even better than the older ones I have.  Great picture and sound quality.  Would recommend to others.
the tv works beautifully. only down side was it connects to any other roku devices in the same room so it turns on various screens simultaneously. resolution was beautiful and sound quality was excellent.
"Nice tv..good value... shipping is a problem on Walmarts efforts. Ordered on Wednesday..said it would come on Thursday..never came..said Friday..said Saturday than ""U"" cancelled had to order all over again ..came Tuesday!"
"Already own a 50"" Roku and love it. This 58"" is equally as great but with much better programming etc. Great tv,great price. Happy with my purchase!!!"
I brought this on Sunday and it's now Thursday. I was going to rate it 3 stars because some of the apps just crash and won't let you open. I then go to turn it on today and it's glitches out. Save your money
"I Love this TV, I was worried about the volume by it being a brand I've never bought before. And bought a sound bar which I haven't had to hook up yet. The volume is Great and the picture is Beautiful."
"The tv screen was broken, the reviews on broken screen was very even the people who had the tv the same after they were installed in their home even the person who reimbursed the had the screen broken from a very lite pressure in their home"
solid tv. can't beat the price or the size. also decent sound so no need for immediate sound bar installation. i had this thing delivered by store. the guy was the nicest guy in the entire world.
This tv doesn't come with picture tune I guess they think it's a perfect picture but it not on some channel I would like to adjust but thank Walmart for delivering
Advertised as coming with a voice control option on the remote. Sadly it does not have that option. It is the most basic Roku remote!  Guess they had to get rid of old stock!
"5 months and the tv died already! This is just a back up TV in the living room, which we hardly use. The main TV that is used in our house is the bedroom we have had that for years. Prime example of you get what you pay for. I do not recommend this brand or TV."

"So an awesome TV. Great picture, great response time. i was avoiding Samsung because i was having issue with the apps and response time. No issues here. Plus the roku and user friendly.  Alsongreat with my PS5. HDR is awesome"
"I love my t.v. the price was very reasonable. I did a price comparison.  It was delivered a day early. The delivery person was kind, competent, and very helpful."
"Great smart TV with terrific picture quality and ROKU to boot, making it so easy for us to dial in HBO plus, Netflix. Hulu and all the rest. Got it in time to watch one of the best Super Bowl games ever at a very reasonable price."
"Absolutely unbelievable, the TV arrived in the trunk of a car with an unstable door. The screen was shattered. Completely, disappointed. A replacement is needed."
"I used to have a 55"" dumb TV with a Fire stick, but this is better. My only complaints are the IR remote instead of Bluetooth and the lack of a voice remote."
"The TV is great . The downside is that we had to purchase an identical TV in just over a year to replace the one we had. Roku and Hisense customer service were no help , pushing responsibility off to each other, and neither company helped us ."
"Of course, I love the price and the Hisense 58"" was very easy to set up, but you really need help to handle a tv this big! It isn't very heavy, just awkward to handle alone. The picture is like ""WOW""! I could not stop looking at it!"
Have had several ofvthis brand TV and this 58in is even better than the older ones I have.  Great picture and sound quality.  Would recommend to others.
the tv works beautifully. only down side was it connects to any other roku devices in the same room so it turns on various screens simultaneously. resolution was beautiful and sound quality was excellent.
"Nice tv..good value... shipping is a problem on Walmarts efforts. Ordered on Wednesday..said it would come on Thursday..never came..said Friday..said Saturday than ""U"" cancelled had to order all over again ..came Tuesday!"
"Already own a 50"" Roku and love it. This 58"" is equally as great but with much better programming etc. Great tv,great price. Happy with my purchase!!!"
I brought this on Sunday and it's now Thursday. I was going to rate it 3 stars because some of the apps just crash and won't let you open. I then go to turn it on today and it's glitches out. Save your money
"I Love this TV, I was worried about the volume by it being a brand I've never bought before. And bought a sound bar which I haven't had to hook up yet. The volume is Great and the picture is Beautiful."
"The tv screen was broken, the reviews on broken screen was very even the people who had the tv the same after they were installed in their home even the person who reimbursed the had the screen broken from a very lite pressure in their home"
solid tv. can't beat the price or the size. also decent sound so no need for immediate sound bar installation. i had this thing delivered by store. the guy was the nicest guy in the entire world.
This tv doesn't come with picture tune I guess they think it's a perfect picture but it not on some channel I would like to adjust but thank Walmart for delivering
Advertised as coming with a voice control option on the remote. Sadly it does not have that option. It is the most basic Roku remote!  Guess they had to get rid of old stock!
"5 months and the tv died already! This is just a back up TV in the living room, which we hardly use. The main TV that is used in our house is the bedroom we have had that for years. Prime example of you get what you pay for. I do not recommend this brand or TV."
Great deal and arrived the next day!  Legs were no problem to attach. I am 71 and 5 ft tall. Wasn't sure if I could get it out of the box and lifted to the stand. I was always careful with the screen and made sure to grasp it without putting any pressure on it.
"Love everything about this newly revised 58"" model number of the R6 Series TV's. Mine was manufactured in December 2022 and these are now packaged in a couple different new variations of box. The older models of this series were definitely hit or miss across all screen sizes over the past couple years, but I think they got it right with this run hopefully! My girlfriend bought a 50"" R6 model at the tail end of 2021, and it was a great tv for about 5 weeks, then completely went black one day all of a sudden. Every possible troubleshoot was performed on our behalf, and eventually just had to call Hisense to have them send out a local technician as we were just past the 30 day WM return window. The technician came to my house and installed a new Roku board into the tv and still nothing, basically deeming it a panel failure. A 'field destroy' was issued and he took the defective tv along with him. Hisense quickly sent out a replacement of the same model, but we sold it immediately to put toward the purchase of another brand on account of the experience we'd just had. I wanted to give Hisense another shot because I've owned a couple of AWESOME tv's of theirs over the past 10 years or so that functioned just fine long term. This brand new revised 58"" has been incredible so far over the past 2 weeks! But time will indeed tell if the optimum performance continues."
"I bought this TV set it up plugged it in super excited 😄 turned it on great picture and sound. fell asleep watching TV and woke up to the tv sound but no picture. you can tell its on obviously because i can hear it but cant see anything!
went thru all troubleshooting online, power cycling etc. now i gotta lug this thing into the store and return it."
"You get what you paid for! We wanted a big (55"") TV for our living room. We already have another brand 50"". This Hisense is just OK! The picture isn't great! If you're looking for something with high resolution, this isn't the one for you! Eventually, we'll purchase the other brand TV to replace this one. But for now, it's just OK!"
So far I really like everything about this TV. The only thing I would say is I can’t seem to get it to turn dish on without using the TV remote. I can get the TV to turn off an on with my dish remote. I just can’t activate the dish with that so I need both remotes.
"Great Buy! I paid $298 for it but now it's like $268. 👍 
I mean a 58 inch flat screen with Roku built-in for under $300... Speaks for itself. It might be missing some bells and whistles and the picture is just slightly above average but still 58"" for under $300."
"This TV looks much larger than 58"". It looks to be at least 60"". The picture is very bright and crystal clear. Since Walmart has started shipping from local stores, my TV's box arrived in pristine condition because it was delivered by an independent contractor in her own personal vehicle rather than being bounced around in a huge FedEx truck. The package was handled with care with no dents or slashes in the box!"
This smart tv is excellent. The picture is very good and the sound system is super. It has all it takes for a very good smart tv if you are looking for one   The only problem was that I wasn't able to connect to my powerful stereo system player through the Aux as like my other TV set but the sound system within the TV itself was good enough to listen with base.
"This is a great TV. Easy to set up. Great picture. Aesthetically pleasing. A great piece to add to anyone home.   My only complaint is Who they use to ship the products. My first TV had a whole in the screen, so it had to be returned, and I had to order another one. The second one had wholes in the box, but no damage to the TV. Get red of FedEx!"
"We begin to experience audio problems when streaming after a couple of months of owning the tv.  We reached at to HiSense, and basically they were not help.  The person I talked with did not even seem to understand how a roku tv worked.  Very disappointing."
"I bought this TV in a WM store mainly because of the low price. $268 for a 58"" 4K TV was too good of a deal to pass. It assembled quickly with no problems. It is a little tricky to get out of the box.

I am a big fan of the Roku platform. I have it on several other TV's and it works great. The Hisense connected to wifi quickly, and I was able to log into my Roku account without any problems. This is great, because all my favorite apps and channels transfer right over. I am also using a HD antenna to get over the air channels. The Hisense scanned and saved all the local channels with out problem.

Picture quality is OK, but not great. There isn't a way to fine-tune brightness and color to the extent found on other TV's. Audio quality on internal speakers is also OK. For the price I can't complain. 

The TV is very light, so I question how long it will last. Also this is my first flat panel that does not have an external power switch, so if the remote gets lost or breaks you can't use the TV.

This is not the greatest TV ever made, but for a 58"" display at a very low price, it does the job."
fantastic color and easy set up. only draw back is it is very thin and you have to be very careful handling it. This is our second one. we bought this larger one. We had a 55 as well and when moving it my husband touched the screen and it crashed all the inside pixels . But love the TV
"We love it.  We have a smaller roku tv and love it so much so we got a bigger one for another room. And it's just perfect.  Delivery was absolutely amazing. I got it so fast , in less than a day. The delivery guy called to nake sure he got to his destination okay, i really appreciated that."
"The person that brought the TV was very customer oriented, he delivered it with care. Setup was very easy and it has a great picture and the sound quality is actually very good for a flat screen, it streams very well and is very responsive. Great TV for a great price."
"If you don't mind at tv that possessed and does whatever it want's to.  Constantly disconnecting the internet connection, volume goes mute but not muted then gets ear piercing loud for no reason. Tv locks up to point you have to unplug it for a few minutes.  If you call Hisense they say it's roku's problem call them. Then Roku says it's Hisense problem. So after 1.5hrs of wait time to talk to someone nothing got resolved. The tv is 3 months old and I am stuck with a tv I can't even use."
"okay this is a tricky review 😁 my first TV I purchased I purchased it online from walmart.com which arrived to me broken, but once I got it back to the store it was a good return and I just purchased a TV from inside the store. got the TV home hooked it up been perfect ever since I had this TV before and I really didn't have any problems with it at all it's just all of a sudden it went out it would not work anymore but my first purchase I had it for off my 6 years so I say it's a good TV."
"Went to Walmart to find replacement for my old 60"" rear projection TV. This Hisense 58"" screen is wider, but a bit shorter in height, and 4K picture is very good. Was pleased the Dolby DTS sound from the TV speakers is quite clear with choices of how you want it modified. Love built in ROKU on these TVs as it shows the guide on the Antenna Channels (and ROKU Channel) to look into future shows for hours/days ahead. Antenna and the streaming channels are top notch clear. Cut the cable about 2 years ago and saves me enough each 3 months to buy this TV for $300. Walmart salesperson was very informative and helped load the TV in our SUV. One of the things I like about this TV is that it has a set of RCA connection jacks on the back which is being phased out on many newer TVs. Love the light weight of this TV at 35 lbs vs the 300 lbs of the monster rear projection TV which sold for about 10X as much back in 2000.  Very pleased so far. Appreciate the lower prices at Walmart. Thanks Sam."
"I got this TV for my mom. The best TV she has owned was an old plasma tv more than a decade old. It could display 1080p content but that was it. On top of that it was undersized. 

The amount of detail that the tv can display makes the large size all the more impressive. At nearly 60 inches big things are crystal clear at 4k."
"This television is perfect for a midsized room or man cave, even a garage. Nice loud sound and perfect clarity for a budget price. It was easy to mount on a wall due to its weight and size and offers a significant upgrade over entry level televisions. Planning on buying a second one for the bedroom."
"Need two to handle this big guy. Setup to cables worked out fine. Bluetooth is still a challenge to get, I had to use Xfinity Channel to get Bluetooth. I love Bluetooth. Roku instructions is for a device that has never been set to another TV. Resetting the ""another TV"" became difficult, leaving me to Xfinity Channel to get Bluetooth."
"This is a big tv, I love it! The picture is nice and clear.  It was under $300. W tax included.  Wise to go grab you one."
TV stopped working after a year and 2 weeks. I called the Hisense customer service and they said there is nothing they can do since it's been barely over a year. Worst product ever.
"Great tv for what you pay for. I use it mainly for my ps5 and have had no problems with it. The only thing I wish was different, is the remote control. Since everybody uses their cable controller, I guess that’s probably why they made it so cheap."
Tv Was Fine When Purchased Brought In Nov 2021. Lines Started Appearing On Tv And Got Worse Have Reset Tv Still Same Problem Called Manufacter No Help Or Repair. All In All Trash Product I Would Just Stick With High Quality Company For Television.
This TV is awesome. Very crisp picture and playing video games on it is such a difference maker. Would definitely purchase another. Worth every penny.
"I ordered this tv once I saw it on sale at around 11:30/12:00 yesterday, and somehow this was delivered around 7:00 the same night. Had no idea it would come the same day. Great tv, pictures is so clear I’m impressed and sound is clear as well. Very happy! Love that there’s a gaming mode as well"
"Tv arrived broken, not physically broken but internally. Customer care said can’t replace as it was delivered from store. I didn’t asked store to deliver I placed order for shipping. In short if it’s broken you can only have refund no replacement. Waste of time and efforts in packing unpacking. So disappointed. Walmart needs to fix this technical/ internal issue."
"This is a horrible tv especially the picture quality. I purchased it last month on the 27, but only opened two days ago. The return time has passed now I’m stuck with it. I contacted the manufacturer and they keep giving me the run around not trying to do anything. Do not waste your time or money and purchase hisense products."
I really like the picture and the price
hand TV for 3 months now no problems don't cheap out get to 58 in a wonderful picture
I love it. I dont have cable but with all the streaming apps I dont need them.
Great smart TV for the price...Great sound and picture. AND...You can't beat the price...
Tv was fine and worked great and then after a few months now when one screen just stays black!
Im happy with it so far. No regrets. I just wish I got a bigger tv for the low price.
Great Tv for an amazing price. I got this for only $278 on sale   Color is awesome
The price waa good and I bougt it. No issue with the set sinxe I got it 2 months ago.
Perfect size to go over our fireplace
"decent tv quality, okay sounds, great budget tv. give you quality with no bells or whistles"
Easy to set up with an awesome picture and sound quality.
Pleased with all aspects of the television.  Excellent choice for the price.
"So far, so good. T.v picture quality is great. i was skeptical at first but i am really impressed."
"This tv is bigger than expected,  really make movie night worth it."
Good quality easy to set up great price!
"Inexpensive, looks and works like any of the other popular brand smart tv’s!"
Super good price and size !! Nothing negative to say
"Purchased tv in Jan of 2022. As with other reviews, black lines started showing up after 7 months and today the tv died. One moth out of warranty.
Do not but this tv it is junk."
I like the size and price of the tv. My complaint was I feel like I am watch an old tv program because the lips on the program doesn't go along with the actual voice of the program.
"Hisense has been a very reliable brand for me and the price is right.  This is the second one I have owned.i now have the 43"" in my bedroom and the 58"" in the livingroom and I love both of them."
We bought this tv looking for a low cost tv for a bedroom. The Roku version is so user friendly and picture quality is great for the price. We have purchased a total of 3 in the last two week.
I love my Hisense Roku Smart TV. It has a clear picture and all of my streaming apps and soooo many more. Not to mention it was very light and easy to set up with a great price!
"Love the big 58"". Picture and sound quality good.  Pick up was awesome experience thru there curbside pickup service. Loaded it and everything for us
Nice tv."
The tv 📺 was delivered and the next day I took it back and they said I could not return it when it arrived damaged and I left the tv in a cart at customer service
"It's been working well so far. I honestly bought it for my mom, who isn't a TV or quality snob. She loves the TV and it's been a huge upgrade from her prior TV. It was a great price, given the size as well."
The worst purchase ever. DO NOT BUY THIS TV bought it on March 11 2023 This is 5/13/2023. Walmart is not gonna take it back. I HAVE TO RATE IT FOR ME TO GET THIS OUT 0 STARS FOR IT
I love my new TV. it is very easy to use and navigate. I  have been using it for a few weeks now and have had no problems yet.  Very happy with my purchase
Beware! I went against my better judgment ordering from here. I was hoping that by now they would have gotten better at handling merchandise. I was wrong. the screen  was all messed up from what the tv was thrown around loading and in transit.
its a roku so it doesn't allow you to adjust certain things or remove cache files to better maintain storage health. My only big the refresh rate doesnt give the crisp inages we had hoped for but for the price jts still very much worth it 👍
"This is my 3rd Hisense TV! Love them all! 65"" in the living room, 55"" out on the deck and now, this 58"" in the bedroom! Forget about the great price.... this is the best TV out there!"
Easy to set up and so easy to navigate between apps. I was expecting some lower quality because of the price but it's amazing better than my expensive tvs.
"HORRIBLE! Continuously loses focus and Walmart will not refund because I am only two days past 30 day window. Walmart is greedy and terrible,  I am taking my business to Amazon only."
"This tv is lightweight, looks great, has a ton of built in apps that you can delete or add to. There is no downside. It has a lot of features. Def buy it if you're even considering it."
"Have issues with apple play and connecting with my phone, works only if i unplug for 5 minutes then plug back in and it will work sometimes. Very frustrating."
Absolutely amazing. I love this tv. I actually received this as a Christmas gift for myself lol. It is still working and I still love it. For me that is shocking
TV didn't work. Called the number on the protection plan I purchased and they said they did not cover whatever was wrong with the TV.  Got a refund from Wal-Mart but did not get a refund on the protection plan.
It came shattered and I returned it and they still charged my card for it and refuse to take the charge off so I paid $300 for a tv that I returned and don't even have.
"This is the 2nd Hisense TV my wife and I have purchased.  We have been very satisfied with 1st unit, so we decided to purchase another.  A friend also has two units and is happy with them.  Good for the money."
Didn't really know the brand so I did some research. My first HD TVs were 1500.00.  This one is much better than those were and they had brand names I knew.
Very clear picture and a great value. The Roku menu makes it easy to navigate right out of the box. Free next day delivery with Walmart  makes it an even better value.
"The picture is washed out.  Everytime there is music it gets super loud even though I have tried every adjustment of sound.  The programming makes no sense.  This is my second ROKU tv, I love my TCL."
"It has very good picture, a major improvement over the much smaller one it replaced. It was very easy to set up and program the streaming services we have. The sound is of reasonable quality too."
this product came on time and was packed safely for shipping. The size of the screen makes it perfect for any room.   great Walmart value..............................
Great tv delivery was super sketch tho big hole in the side of the box by the screen also stire foam is stuck between the screen and the side of the tv but still works great
"This is my very smart tv, and i am so pleased with all these neat features. The picture is amazing. The colors are extraordinary, and these size is huge. The sound is unbelievable, very hi-tech and is more of a theatre listening. Well, I am highly impressed, and I love it! :))))"
"Shipping was  fast. 3 days. I was worried such a big TV would arrive damaged. Box had minor bumps and scuffs but the TV was undamaged.  Beautiful picture, sound, and build quality. I researched Hisense prior to purchase and knew that when you get one undamaged, they are as good if not better than many of the high dollar TVs...... No one will believe you paid less than 300."
"We haven't had this TV but a couple of weeks now but so far we are absolutely in love with it! We have had Roku TVs in the past but only in the TCL brand. The 4K option on this TV is amazing, we had no idea how much better the quality would be! the price for the size of this TV with the Roku option along with 4K was unbeatable! We had a TV go out and I started to do my research... and this TV by far beat out others at any other store!"
Picture Quality is great with support for Dolby Vision and HDR. Sound Quality is also reasonable. It's one of the best (if not the best) TVs you can purchase for less than $300.  Built-in Roku is an added bonus and has a lot of options for free content. The TV has 3 HDMI 2.0 inputs with one of them supporting ARC.
"Great picture, decent sound quality, love the integrated ROKU - makes watching TV via antenna so easy, easy to see whats on with the programming schedule shown onscreen.  My previous TV which is only a year old required multiple button presses just to see what was coming on next.  This one is so much better.  It also has a replay feature for antenna TV - connect a 16gb USB thumb drive and once a TV channel starts playing it starts recording the program, which will allow going back up to 90 minutes in the show.  So if you dislike commercials, set it to the station/program you are going to watch, let it start playing and go off and do something else for 30 minutes, then come back and rewind to beginning of the show...you can skip through all the commercials then.  
The only negative thing I can say about this - is that the side view photo in the posting is incorrect.  It shows 2 USB ports.  There is only 1 USB port.   Also the photo showing the back - doesn't show the older style video/audio input.  But it is there (2 audio inputs red and white, and a video input yellow). 
When you mount the legs, there are 2 different positions they can be attached.  When attached to the innermost position, the widest area apart they are is 24"".   Thus if you have a stand that is 25"" wide, this TV would be able to sit on it.   Total width of screen is 51"".
One other note - its not a voice remote.  I guess you have to use the app on a phone to get voice control."
"Very happy with my tv. Great price,picture and sound. I am unhappy with the delivery people. They just left it on my porch. They didn't even knock on my door to let me know they were there. They are supposed to have somebody sign for it.  I'm lucky it wasn't stolen."
"Tv goes in and out. Freezes, closes, or restarts any app I use. I’ve given Hisense a call about it and they told me to call Roku. Roku couldn’t help me so I had to go back through Hisense who then I’ve had dropped phone calls and no ones given me a call back after I was told they would. I wouldn’t recommend this TV for my six year old son. I guess that’s what I get for being cheap, ahaha jokes on me. Stick with SONY."
"This is our 3rd Hisense TV as we upgraded our 50"" to a 65"". Our 65"" went out after two years last month but we had the extended warranty through Walmart. They gave us a refund that allowed us to purchase a new one. So why not go for the 75""? And I upgraded to this 58"" Hisense Roku TV in my Craft room."
"Great TV, ESPECIALLY on a budget. Great blacks/contrast, decent grays, and the color is pretty good too! And the Roku OS is SO MUCH BETTER than Samsung's Smart Things.  ONE PIECE OF ADVICE FOR GOOGLE ASSISTANT: go to the Google Home App on your Smartphone>Under your household name you'll see a a horizontal row of options: CHOOSE LINK TO ROKU or SET-UP ROKU> enjoy."
"This TV is amazing!  I upgraded an older 55"" 1080p Insignia (BestBuy) unit with this.  Let me just start off by saying WOW!  The clarity and picture quality is EPIC.  I have been using Roku for the past 10 years but this is the first Roku TV I have bought.  I love having everything built-in.  It makes it easier for my kids and wife when watching/using.  I am already thinking of getting the smaller 43"" to upgrade our Master Bedroom TV.  I got this one on sale for just under $300 and feel it is definitely worth more!

Bottom line - Get this if you are upgrading an older 720p or 1080p unit.  Having Roku Built-In is GREAT!  One remote does it all!"
Easy set up
"Grabbed this tv during the Black Friday deal for $198 and got lucky to get it from a store with a price match. All I can say is for this price point, the tv is great. 

With the addition of Dolby audio/video it’s been a great purchase for my bedroom. The picture is clear and crisp. Just make sure to change the brightness settings to enjoy the vivid picture."
"have been using the TV for a week now, mainly for cable viewing and streaming online content, no issues so far. the delivery was excellent, was left safety outside my door, the outer package did not have any damage and the TV inside too has no visible damages."
Tv delivered destroyed
so far so good I was worried because of reading the reviews about the shipping process but I actually got it way early I got it in like four or five days after I ordered it and I've only had it for about a week and a half two weeks so I'm crossing my finger but so far so good good picture so I guess it's maybe a hit or miss from all the reviews I've read however I did buy the 4 year warranty plan that is absolutely efficient with anything you buy over a hundred bucks. I'll try and give a further update as time goes by
"I really liked this TV when it was first purchased! It’s big, clear, and thin! But I bought it in July of 2022 and I just don’t understand what’s happening there’s black lines in the center of my screen they weren’t there as of a few days ago but I’m just super disappointed in the fact that I paid $300 for a tv that barely lasted 6 months it’s very disheartening"
"This is a very beautiful screen although 4 months in the screen went green with lines and warranty department gave me a huge run around they refused to send a technician out , it was mounted flat on the wall and I couldn't find serial number   they were no help at all . obviously from the other reviews it is a bad  model  . I recommend do NOT purchase this tv 
no help at all ....."
"Very displeased, have ordered 2 tvs online, both came by fed x, first one had so many puncture holes that one went thru the tv. You have to load it up snd take it back to customer service, I'm talking a 58"" tv. We still have not been refunded, this was Dec 29. The second came by fed x, we refused it because it had puncture holes also. I realize it's fed x that's making the mistakes but now we have 2 tvs that have not been refunded back to our account so we refuse to purchase one till refunded. We have over $600 out  there still ."
"This TV is awesome! Clarity, sound, and the amount that free live channels you get is unmatched. I really like this brand. Bought 3 for everyone in the house. You won’t be disappointed. Idk about anyone else but the quality you get for the price is incredible. Don’t pass it up."
Bought in March 2022. Picture went dark Nov 2022. Hisense can’t get a technician to come out here. They will ship a replacement with a credit card hold. Then send the bad one back to them. It’s been a nightmare trying get this replaced. Don’t buy this!!! Walmart said no to a return.
After tv did a automatic factory update sound went outcompletly. Have done all the things I could find online to see if I can fix the issue and nothing called hisense support and nothing. Don't waste your money spend a little more and buy a quality product from a brand that stands firm on their name.
I liked the price for this big 58 inches TV. The screen has a beautiful contrast and colors. I was impressed for this price range. There is some sort of discoloration on the borders but is minimal. The Roku operating system is very intuitive and deep. A lot of free content. Tv is not so heavy.
"I ordered this tv from Wal-mart last July.They deleivered it the very next day! This is a great buy, I payed $298 for it and its worth every penny! Great picture,and easy to set up! I think it may have been Walmart workers that brought it to the door, but it was in perfect condition, and packaged very well.This is a very good buy in my opinion!"
This product is Junk!  I ordered 2 of these for my kids for Christmas and neither one worked after hanging on the wall.  After a long process with Hisense I have spent hours trying to get them warrantied. Hookup and black screen with vertical colored lines throught the picture.
"The TV is good, the support service is excellent. But I had to wait three days for the delivery due to the fact that it was constantly postponed. I have repeatedly (3 or 4 times) written to the support service, and each time they reported new delivery dates. The product was delivered only after I sent a request for a refund and cancellation of the order. Impressions are quite mixed."
"Three stars considering I had to order it three times before I got a TV that wasn’t completely cracked. It’s a fine TV, but the stress to go through ordering, returning, ordering, returning, and order again was irritating. Additionally, these are DEEP cracks - you can’t see them until you plug the TV in, meaning they clearly had something go wrong at manufacturing and still sent probably 100  broken TVs out considering so many of these bad reviews."
"Apparently the bluetooth does not work with any soundbar unless it is roku's. Minor inconvenience, but other than that, so far it has behaved pretty well and good picture. The remote has the TV volume and mute on the side, the mute button tends to get pushed everytime I pick it up, I also wish the four preset buttons were programable, as I don't use 3 of the 4 presets, just a waste of space in my opinion."
Came withA big crack
"Hisense TV is an Excellent buy. I bought a small one 3 years ago for a surprise present for my fiancé for  the patio. I was very impressed because the quality was better than our 85” inch Samsung Smart TV that was on the wall in our living room. We could see almost side by side from our big window in the living room. The quality was surprisingly Impressive! More vivid colors and brighter! That is why I trust this brand! And I love the price as well! Love my New TV right now! I know I made an excellent choice! Will definitely recommend! 

The first TV I ordered came a day early when it said in 2 days. I was surprised it came the next day and I was very excited! But when I plugged it in, it had a crack on the screen. So I called and returned it. It was easy and had gotten picked up from my house. Then, I ordered a new one and it came the next day as well. I was very pleasantly surprised again and very impressed with the service! 

I would order anything from Walmart again! Great service! From customer service to delivery. Very impressive! I Definitely Recommend!"
"They say you get what you paid for but not this time, wrong! Got TV on roll back price so I was not expecting such a great TV. Picture Quality is awesome takes up very little space sound could be better but nothing up sound bar didn't fix. Would recommend it if you get it at a good price."
"All went well. I put this deal in my cart and purchased it online to be picked up. However, my Walmart just plain sold out of this special deal TV at my store in Sayre, Pa. Still, they offered me the same deal price, free shipping, and TV arrived today and works great. Walmart's price on this special deal was $100 less than Amazon's price! Bottom line is Walmart wanted to make sure that even though it was sold out, I deserved to still buy this TV at its special price.  Thank you Walmart."
"This tv is hilarious! Visio is a great brand, no doubt, but this tv lets you know it's cheap when you pull it out of the box to put it together. Let me be clear, my issue is with putting this thing together. I needed a PC monitor, but the prices were ridiculous, and the brands were unknown, so I settled for a tv. I paid less than $200 for this one. THE LEGS TOOK ME 10 MINUTES TO INSTALL!!! There. There's my complaint. You have to screw four small screws (two for each leg) into the bottom of the tv. This surprised me because the larger tvs, including my 85"", require sliding the legs in, and they secure into place via a mechanism or whatever. No screws. Y'all, these screws were the MOST difficult to manage with my man-sized (XL) hands while installing the legs. Tip: Use a magnetic tip screwdriver. I was sweating and annoyed afterward. The other interesting thing was the plug. Plugs have been detachable for decades.. for moving and tripping hazards. This one isn't.. I can't decide if that's a problem, but I just don't like it. My recommendation, if you purchase this tv, is to hang it on the wall. It's very  lightweight (good thing). Forget them legs! Oh, and the remote comes with batteries. That's good. Mine were Duracell. The price point is good. Just remember, tvs are cheaper nowadays because they're used to collect data on your usage and preferences:)"
TV is OK at best. Only having two HDMI inputs if you’re using the eARC for a sound bar is unacceptable in this day and age the company told me they don’t put more HDMI ports in until get to a 65 inch TV which is stupid. My old Vizio that was 55 inch and was probably 10 years old (and still working) had an eARC port and four HDMI inputs. I would look at a different brand for a TV. Their customer service is pathetic. I also bought the AX 5100 G sound bar and it sounded like people were talking through a Folgers coffee can and I spent five hours troubleshooting the TV and the sound bar with no resolution and the response was will get back with you in a week.
"For one, there was no remote. I used a remote from one of my other tv's. going thru it , foind out it was used . call the Wal-Mart number put on hold for 15 minutes , then hung up on me. called back got this lady with an attitude, and wouldn't listen to what i was saying , basically telling me i was full of it.  on a good note the picture was nice . taking back to the store, so it can be a person to person conversation."
"I was a little concerned about buying this TV, because I have always owned Samsung and Vizio. Turns out, I love this TV more than any of the others in the house. The menu and app setup are perfect. If my other TVs ever need to be replaced, I'm going with a Hisense Roku TVs."
I was expecting a much better picture from a 4K UHD (2060) LED LCD Roku Smart TV. I have a 43 inch version from the same manufacturer with the exact same specs . That one makes me feel like I'm inside the football field when watching a game it is so clear and crisp. This 58 inch felt like we were watching the Superbowl on a somewhat degraded tape instead of live TV.  Not requiring return but disappointing loss in vividness (yes we adjusted all controls to get best picture) to get bigger screen.
"When television was delivered, I was a little worried, bottom of box was wet and falling apart. I was worried it may be damaged.
So far no problems, the instructions that were included, it was very easy to hook up. Once hooked up, you just had to answer a few questions. Beautiful picture, great sound, and great price at the time of purchase. Very pleased so far with the 58 inch Hisense television"
I dislike the shipping it was suppose to arrive yesterday and its still not here and its at a store that is 25 minutes from my home when I called yesterday I was told I could not pick it up from the store because my items were awaiting a driver . This is a disgrace.
"Bought this TV on November 10th, November 19th comes around and the TV will not turn on, and Walmart will not accept the Return because we have already thrown the box away what a joke , have went through the manual reset procedure and unplugged and relocated with no luck"
"We needed a new TV, we have been streaming now for almost two years. I loved the price compared to a regular flat screen. I first was hesitant but read other’s reviews and decided to try it.
Great value for the money, love the ease to set it up, only thing I don’t like is the remote. My other remotes have voice activation, I wish this remote had that. I use that a lot on my other tv’s."
"Picture is very crisp and clear, with no washing some show when viewing atcan angle. Roku interface is the same as with the units, connection to our wireless is solid. We have a 70"" LG which is in storage with our ither stuff after disaster storm damage, we bought this to have an ibterim solution.

We have been vety impressed. A ton of bang for the buck. if you want a great picture on a decently large tv, i would highly recommend it.  If youre on a budget, or even if you arent, it holds up to much more expensive brands.

we are very very happy with it, and it has provided entertainment that was much needed! i expected a passable picture and interface for under $300. instead we got a GREAT  picture and access to our streaming services for one affordable price."
"I wish there was some written instructions on how to use the controller and explain how to download what you call apps.  so much is very confusing and meant we had to wait for someone to come and help us understand as just showing things once is not giving us the steps to do things again, so we loose out of things that we do not remember HOW  or WHERE to find things"
All I can say is good size good pic.. now here the down size I lose internet connection all the dang time.. I have to reset it .. now it made work for couple of days then back doing it again.. sometime I would just use my firestick to watch tv. But sometime when I turn my tv on the connection is working then maybe a week later it’s not.. it’s a headache but I pay 298.00 and I’m not going to waste money .. I’m keep doing firestick until my internet pop back up.. all that crap about moving ur internet box closer don’t waste ur time is all crap.. but if I had read the view before buying it I won’t buy it it. It was too late. I brought the tv in March and I started to have problems in June it went from June until oct and internet work again and it January and it back. It working again
"I purchased this tv in January 2022 and started having issues in September 2022.  Lines and splotches starting appearing on the right of the screen.  I contacted Hisense support online and through messages I was told I had to return the tv for repair and they sent me a return label to return it in the original box.  Thankfully I kept the box but it was in storage and I needed to locate it.  After dealing with an extended sickness, I was finally well enough to find the box and called back to request another label.  At that time I asked how long the process would take and she was unable to give any type of time frame at all.  I then asked what if the tv could not be repaired and she said they would send a replacement.  I asked how long that would take and was told  the request would then be sent to their factory and they would have to see if they had the tv in stock.  Again I was told she had no way of estimating how long that could possibly take.  I purchased this tv for my family as a means for entertainment but now due to the product being defective we will be without a television for an unknown period of time.  I feel like this is unacceptable since I do not have the extra funds to just go buy another tv for my household.  I tried to explain this to the representative but it was just like sorry, it is what it is.  Basically I paid for it, it doesn't work right, and now I will be without a television for who knows how long without any form of compensation for my inconvenience.  I have been reading reviews online and they do not give me hope that the tv will be repaired or a replacement will be received if I return the tv.  I'm considering taking this as a loss (an unfortunate hard lesson learned) and just filing a complaint with the BBB."
"I have 3 Hisense TVS, all purchased at Walmart.  The first was a 70 inch purchased 2 yrs ago.  The picture quality was great, the TV was easy to use, and the price was very good, so I shorty afterwards purchased a 65 inch for my bedroom.  I purchased the 58 inch in December, 2022 for another bedroom.  I am looking to purchase another 58 or 65 inch and replace my Apple TV in my living room.  I absolutely love my Hisense TVs!! The price and quality are unbeatable!!"
"Started having trouble with it not connecting to my internet after only 4 days of buying it. Couldn't return bc I didn't have the box for it, and  the company wouldn't send me one for it. Will never buy again ever!! I've had to factory rest 3 times, and it still works then quits. A big waste of money and cannot return!!!"
"Absolutely loved the TV, all that we had wanted to replace our old one.  Greatly disappointed upon opening the box, unpacking and plugging it in to check it out only to find the screen cracked down the entire middle of the screen.  Something that would only occur if it had been dropped.  Only reason I plugged it in to check it was delivery person delivered it by himself, dragged it up the sidewalk, could not see from what vehicle (but imagine it was a chore for him).  Will NEVER purchase anything like this delivered from Walmart ever again.  Lesson learned.  Only rating a one because of the damage and mishandling by delivery person.  Worst part wasn't even this, we have to wait 3 weeks AFTER they receive it back for a refund and will have to wait for a replacement TV after that.  Poor response time as well!"
It came broke
"TV was stolen and the TV was ordered by mistake.   I do ha e the poli e report.  Now I had to go through all of this and not knowing this had happened.   just being the good Samaritan i am, so waiting on you guys to put these 7 dollars back on to my account"
Not suitable as a 4k computer monitor. The LCD panel circuitry dithers adjacent pixels (creating a moire checkboard pattern) for mid brightness colors. (this is usually done to enable a reduced bandwidth rate of data to the panel as each pixel cannot show the HDMI exact commanded brightness. Dithering between adjacent 'fixes' this as a cheap solution). It is usually OK for TV watching but looks terrible as a PC display when greys and other midbrightness colors are shown.
"I have owned this exact model of Hisense TV since Black Friday last year. I was surprised at what a clear picture it had. It is just as sharp as the more expensive Samsung I have in the family room. 
There have been no problems with it whatsoever.
 Tip: The volume button is on the right side of the remote.
 Knowing that may save you a call to tech support. 🤓"
I purchased one of these about a year ago and it worked great unfortunately the screen broke when I moved from Illinois to Minnesota so I went and purchased another one from Walmart when I got it home there was a lot of screen flashing so I took that one back and got another one thinking it was just effective while the second one I purchased did the same thing I'm not really impressed with it and I'm taking this one back and purchasing a different brand of TV I've been a Hisense user for about 3 years and I'm not impressed with their quality now
"I bought this 58 inch TV a year ago and it still works great.  Bought it to replace a 50 inch tv, the extra 8 inches makes a big difference.  The size is great, the picture quality is great, sound quality is good, and there is no lag and there has been no freeze ups or other concerns.   The Roku programming is great too."
"This is a nice purchase for me. The picture quality is really good. I enjoy free ROKU channels. Changing from 32 inches of TV to 50 inches of TV is a great change for me. I am glad that I chose this brand. It is affordable, it has great picture quality and a wonderful sound."
"i decided to cut off my dish and go with streaming. i got a 58 inch smart tv for the living room and a 43 inch for the bedroom, were easy to set up. i subscribed to Hulu getting more channels cheaper than i was with dish. does buffer a little but not enough to be a problem"
"i saw the negative reviews and ignored them and because of the price i decided to risk it all. and did!! I BOUGHT THIS TV A WEEK AGO and its already glitching.. it gets fuzzy and everything on the screen starts jumping. i cant even watch my shows,i cant even see what im watching. please,please dont ignore this review,if your like me and see that its a good price and want to risk it...please dont. use the money and get a smaller tv with better quality...❤️❤️"
"Easy set up, great quality, my husband didn’t know I switched the TV, so when he came down the next morning to watch football, he said wow, they must have done something different with their cameras the field is so crisp it looks so real!  I needed this odd 58” size to maximize my tv space, I couldn’t use 60” and Hisense made it!  Win all the way around and price is fantastic!"
We purchased this in Nov 2021. Everything was great until we returned from a vacation in Oct 2022 to find the screen covered in lines. Unplug and replug and they go away for a bit but always return. TV essentially unwatchable unless you want to unplug mid-show to reset the screen.
"We got this TV for $360 including tax, shipping, and a 4-year anything goes policy just before Christmas 2022.  Thus far, it has performed fabulously, and I have no complaints.  I've been able to hook up a TOSLINK connection to my stereo, and now I can have the TVs sound (which is excellent on it's own) and my stereo at the same time."
"I overall liked it . Picture and sound is good. This is the second one that I’ve bought in the past month. The first one that I just took back yesterday, I had for a couple weeks and it started to flash “black” . It was a quick flash then slowed down so you could actually catch it.
I took that one back yesterday and bought this one yesterday. This one has flashed black also today. Don’t know what the heck is the problem. This one is going back tomorrow and I will buy another brand."
"I have purchased 3 Hisense TV's in the past. Two 50"" and a 75"". The two 50"" went out at 5 years. I loved everything about these TV's. Easy setup easy Xfinity to transfer on into it. Because they only lasted 5 years I went with a new Samsung for my bedroom. It was a cheaper model and was difficult to navigate through the setup. My only complaint about Hisense is they only last 5 years"
I hope I have a  4 year protction plan on my  new Henese tv. Because I added the protection a day later after my order. And some how had another new  tv delievered today and had the delievery driver returned this order before the fedex even got it off the truck today. how do  I find out  if I have a protection plan on my new tv.
"This purchase is the first for me; I was not sure about the Hisense TV or Roku.  I was cautiously optimistic about the purchase, and over the next few days/week that I was learning about it, I have come to appreciate all its options.   The only thing I do not like about it is the cheap remote that comes with it; I would like the remote to have a keypad on it to directly input a channel or make selections in the search mode."
"I love this brand and have bought multiple Roku tv’s, but after barely using this particular living room tv that I’ve had for a year has begun to give  me issues when i turn it on it displays just a black background with no images. I reset and works for a bit but goes back to the same problem."
"This TV is 65 days out of the box and it now get an overheat warning.  After several on screen warnings.... the tv shuts down.  After 10 mins you are able to turn tv back on... but the errors continue.  I've done everything in the book to remedy this with no luck.  Move TV to open area, changed power outlets, turn on ceiling fan on high, wiped of rear vents... nothing worked.  I contacted walmart... stated that i did NOT by an extended warantee. They stated that the TV can NOT be exchanged because its past the 30 store garantee.  I now have to contact Hisense and get them to come firgure out the next move.  I am so MAD and DISCUSSED on choosing this brand.  Goodbye Hisense... Hello LG.  I have a High End LG tv in my living room and Ive had no issues what so ever.  I should have known better than to buy a different brand tv.

 DO NOT BY WITHOUT AN EXTENDED WARANTEE THRU WALMART."
If I could give this trash zero stars I would. Purchase this tv didn’t even last 3months and the screen blacked out. Don’t even bother contacting Hisense about a 1year manufacturer warranty. They don’t answer nor respond to emails anyways. If u decided to purchase this trash anyway do yourself a favor and purchase a extended warranty but by the time u do all that you could’ve purchased a great brand tv with a company who stands on there product and warranty.
"A bit of backlight bleed on the edges, but you don't really notice it unless there is a really dark scene. Blacks are not the blackest, but pretty good.  Its surprisingly bright with good contrast, the colors really pop.  No judder issues, its pretty smooth on wide pans. I got this as a bedroom TV, and I'm still surprised it only costs 300 bucks.  Its a rad TV for the price."
"To start with the dislikes. I have found nothing I dislike about this television. The likes to start it off I like to get the most out of my money and I definitely got that here, the picture quality is absolutely amazing. The one thing I have always loved about Roku before having a smart tv was just how simple it is to use and this tv holds up to that, I believe anybody could get this and use it with out much issue. To end this review I have to say buy it buy it now"
"This is the second Roku equipped TV that I have bought and I love it! I decided about a month ago to disconnect my cable. I realized as high as my cable bill was it would be much simpler to have a good Smart TV that I could just download streaming services on. Because the cost of streaming services even with the six that I have is still cheaper than the cable in my area, lol. Plus this TV has amazing sound and great picture. The first one I bought was two years ago for my bedroom and it is still amazing. The one I purchased two years ago what is a 47 inch I believe, so when I needed a new TV for my living room I bought the 58 inch TV. And I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves streaming services. There is only one downside, it only has one usb slot. However that can be fixed. So you can make it work no worries."
I love the way it lets the poor watch great movies and I love the clear picture
"SO FAR SO GOOD, WAITING TO SEE HOW MANY YEARS IT LAST ME THE LAST TV I GOT IN THIS BRAND STOP WORKING A MONTH BEFORE MY WARRANTY EXPIRED."
Broke in under a year. Screen suddenly went black while watching tv but the red light on the bottom still responds to remote buttons being pressed.
"I ordered this tv , expecting to wait a few days for it to arrive, to my amazement, it came that very afternoon"
Only had tv 2 weeks and its no longer working it comes on but cant select live tv or other functions
"what I like about the New TV of course is the size, and the amazing color. it now sits in the bedroom. So far so good."
It was better than I expected and brought right to my front door you couldn't ask for any better service
Easy to setup picture quality is good big screen Roku OS is very simple to use but powerful great price a steal
So Far so good! no issues yet! and the size is amazing. Most people think it's a 65 inch at first glance
"Needed to replace a 48"" unit and found this 58"" for a comparable price. Pretty decent unit, but the picture quality is just OK."
I like my Tv but I can't seem to watch Netflix on it. It allows me to find the movie I wanna watch but once I press play it kicks me off.
Worth for the money. Good clarity amazing sound quality and overall has many options with roku. Brought it for $260
Works great so far. We bought it for our closed in porch. It has a network port on it so you can plug it right in to your router.
Driver was amazing his service was good he did a great job and even Carried the tv up the stairs himself
We love it! We got it for a great price and love all the features on it! It's big enough to see from room to room in our small house.
not a bad tv easy to set up the legs are kind of odd. the roku is lagging and the remotr lack some response time. but picture is good sound is ok.
"Don't buy this tv. The legs are unstable and my tv fell over and the screen is damaged!
Even though I bought extended warranty it's not covered."
netflix and prime video don't run consistently. I have to unplug the TV and reset it at least 2 times every 7 days.
So cute! Very happy with my new TV
Excellent price for this smart tv. Best reception and can b competitive with other top brand tvs  that cost more.
"beautiful picture, the colors pop, everything is crispy and sharp. very happy with everything overall the price was the best part."
"Great picture, set is well worth the money. The only is that it always starts on the Roku screen and you have to change it"
Best tv ever will never by a different brand the speaker is awesome and picture is great don't need to go the movies there is no dislike I love my tv
Tv works great great picture I love it
"The tv is a great price. This is our second one to replace a smaller tv in one room. Easy set up with this Roku tv. Also, the gentleman (which we didn’t get his name) was super nice and courteous. We hope he gets recognized for his kindness."
"I loveeeeee itttt!!!!!! I was scared it was going to come broken but it didn't🤩thank god! It's so big , bigger than I thought it was going to be. But overall I'll give it a 100000/10 😍it's most definitely worth it!"
"Had never heard of a 58inch tv before, but I'm glad I took the chance nice TV beautiful picture and would recommend to any one thinking of getting a tv. Try this one won't be disappointed."
The Hisense 58” Roku TV is amazing. Simple setup. Huge screen with clear picture and sound. It was even delivered straight to my door!  I would totally recommend the purchase of this item.
got it screen cracked can't get it picked up from FedEx cuz it doesn't fit in my car until Monday can't get my my money back and I don't have the money to rebuy it on the internet like I did the first time
"I have written a review on the 58in TV I received  
came on time and without  flaws.  I truly love this TV it is a perfect fit in the room  I selected for it... 
No complaints on the product or the delivery.  They were both perfect."
This is a great TV but it is a simple one.  It doesn't have all the extra features that high end TV's have but it doesn't have the high price and I consider it to be a great buy!
I am disappointed in the picture. I purchased the same set for my mom at Christmas and it has a sharper picture. For the price I can live with it and I did get the extended warranty just in case.
"The legs was to long to sit on top of my dresser with falling off. I put book under one side and one leg on other side. they should put legs in the center, so people want have a problem with sitting their tv any where"
"i am i love with this TV. NICE size for my bedroom.
i had it delivered. it arrived in perfect condition!
the sound and picture charity is amazing. you wont be disappointed. love my tv"
This particular TV was recommended to me by 3 different people who previously had purchased the Hisense brand.  I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.  Color is fantastic!
"it is SUPER fast, easy hookup. I have a TLC and I dont love it, but I LOVE this TV. Wish I had measured because I would've gotten a bigger one but this Tv is amazing. Very affordable, Came the SAME DAY I ordered it!!"
"I am so upset. I spent a lot of money hanging this TV buying the Mount setting it up and now I can't speak into the remote TV commands. I have poor eyesight and cannot type in every single thing I want to search. I am returning it, which is a super inconvenience."
Walmart.com does not stand behind what they sell.  Do yourself a favor and burn your money instead.  You'll be happier with your choice.
This tv has excellent picture and sound at a great price! I'm so happy with my purchase would recommend!
"Luv this tv the image in hd beautiful,the speakers great very satisfied with purchase thank u Walmart!"
I opened up the box and the tv screen was cracked. I returned the tv and decided to get a different brand that was more expensive.
I purchased this TV in March 2022 by July 2022 TV randomly started to black out. Then it will go back to normal for a while then it will bleed throught the screen white with lines all over TV .
I just received this tv. Watch two episodes on Starz and now the tv is only playing sound. No video whatsoever. I am beyond frustrated at this point
"I did not dislike anything, I love everything about this purchase.  I have told many people about the price and satisfaction of it."
Make sure you have a tv stand large enough the legs are wide.  It's not a stand in t the middle.  Great TV quality
"buffer issues when streaming. stops often, so we stopped using it. wish I could exchange for a different brand"
Great value! Bought it for my roommates for Christmas 2022 and they love it! Picture is super sharp and clear. Just bought another one for myself!
"Wonderful picture and sound, love the apps that are available on it too. Easy to use and customize, couldn't be happier with this purchase."
Product was damage when opened box
Love the price first and foremost but the color and clarity of the picture are great and sound quality is amazing!
Grainy picture for a 4K telivision. However it suits our current needs. For the price (under $300 out the door)can't complain to much.
The best tv yet nice sound picture and more
"So far I really like this tv. It was a great price, and I hope it holds up for more than just 12 months. My LG died just over 12 months."
"I love the picture, size, and style. I wish this TV had interest access so I wouldn't have had to buy a fire stick."
"Make sure you get the protection plan,this tv goes out every 3 years and I have ordered 3,but I had the all state 3 yr protection plan for 30 bucks."
Biggest tv I've ever owned.  Able to get cuz price was good.
Great size for the price. simple menu. very nice picture. Can't really go wrong when making this purchase!!!
"I liked the price%26size of this tv%26the picture%26volume come in great,such a great buy,very happy with this tv purchase TY"
Know that this TV is going to stop working within 5 months of buying it. and hi sense is impossible to get in contact with.
Great TV for the price! Love all the features of the Roku TV and only needing one remote to do everything. The interface is very easy to use as well.
"I bought this TV in October.  Presently, my TV has lines going through it.  I saw good reviews on this TV, but it seems as though I got a bad one."
"The picture is not crisp and clear. I bought an ONN roku tv and wish I had bought another like it, because the picture quality is excellent."
Loved the convenience and large selections.
"This tv was delivered fast I mounted it on to my bedroom wall it wasn't bad I did myself 
Great picture would buy again"
I mean it’s lit or wateverrr
"Given the low price for this TV, it is a fantastic deal!!  Large, crisp clear image.  No it doesn't have the depth and texture of a $3000 TV but its not a $3000 TV, its a $350 TV and its well worth it!"
"There are two big holes on the box when the TV arrived! I knew something was up so I plugged in the TV to check and I was right, the TV has a huge crack. I have to wait another 10 days for the replacement now."
"Bought this brand for an outdoor TV, didn't want anything expensive considering it would have to be withstanding various weather conditions and 2 years later its still holding up great..so bought another as a gift and he Loves it!"
i like it alot. good price. great picture.great sound. a ton and half of channels for free. stupid WOW. very nice looking tv. can be used on small table top.great streaming need internet. super easy set up. its very light. over all it ROCKS.
TV barely lasted 6 months. At 5 months i had to start resetting/factory resetting for it to even come on and show picture. Now it will not come on at all.
I brought this for my son in June and it stopped working in Sept a day after the 60 days! This is the 2nd one I brought this year and they both went out. Waste of money
"Less than a year old and the screen is white but the sound still works. So frustrating, and disappointing. I have really enjoyed this tv up to this point."
The TV itself is fine but I do not like the way you have to go to the  Guide to select a different channel and it takes forever to scroll through  The guide
All tvs ordered were delivered broken and I was charged for each one.  Initially ordered only one and was charged over a thousand dollars due them being broken!  Totally unacceptable!
"I’ve no issues to this point.  This is the 3rd Hisense TV I’ve purchased.  (Each purchase was to get a larger screen).
My youngest son and his wife have had a Hisense TV and they were the ones who recommended Hisense to me."
Picture and sound is off.  Constantly delays in the sound.  Tried multiple times resetting but to no avail it keeps happening.  Not worth the price when the sound doesn't match the picture.  Troubleshooting doesn't work.
"This TV has a great picture, and easy to use smart apps for a reasonable price. I only wish I had paid more attention to the remote that came with it, because it does not have voice command capabilities."
"measure your tv's or maybe someone can explain how we ordered a 58"" tv and it only measures 51"". Didn't notice until months later so can't do anything about it."
"They delivered it to the granny unit next door. I bought it as a gift for my mother, 86, and her partner, 80. They had a hard time getting assistance moving it from the granny unit to the main house with many stairs to climb."
This TV's definition picture pixel count whatever you call it is not as good as the last TV I had I am a little bit disappointed in the quality of the TV picture
I like that the picture is so clear and the color is perfect! It's easy to use the roku control and it also works very easily with our other channel control.
"This TV has all the features that I wanted. Works great, is easy to setup and the picture is really good. 
I recommend Hisense products. I have 2 of them."
"The price for the size of the television! The picture is simply amazing. The easy to operate, add your favorite channels, programs, etc. 
I highly recommend for purchase!! The reviews for the functionality is everything it’s said to be and more!!!"
Was great for the one week that it worked. Then suddenly just gave out and did all the troubleshooting that Hisense tells you to do. None of it worked at all.
This TV is good quality and nice picture and clarity! I am going to purchase another one and would recommend to anyone who is on a budget and looking for quality!
I bought this tv 3 times back to back and had to return them. The first two had cracked screens and the third tv would not turn on. Will not buy this brand again.
"Tv suddenly stopped working after 10 months of purchasing, i called the customer support no response neither online nor on phone, i lost my money actually"
"Not real sure, at present. I just had it installed for about a month and learning it.  So far, so good.  I mostly watch at late night, and I like what I‘be seen so far."
It’s easy to set up. Literally does it itself from easy to understand prompts. Great quality screen and audio. I’ve had zero issues and it’s a simple system and all the options I could possibly as for.
"great TV, picture is crystal clear and I love the fact that you can connect a sound bar and that Roku is built into the TV, highly recommend, cant beat it for the price"
The TV is good. The viewing angles can make the colors seem distorted. When you sit directly in front of it - its clear and brilliant. For the money its okay. I am a fan of Roku so having that built in made me happy.
"Very easy to work, works well with satellite TV.  Has a great picture and sound.  Tv has all the channels and apps we could want.  I would definitely buy again."
"saw the price on 58"" Roku Smart tv and couldn't pass up....took home myself from store...fired up immediately and has been functioning great for 10 months with NO PROBLEMS....I am very happy and have added some more apps"
This unit was an excellent value. The picture quality is GREAT and it’s easy to use and set up. I was so impressed that I purchased a second one and my daughter too.
Technology has come a long ways for flat screen TVs. The current technology in the Hisense is awesome. The cost for the TV is unbelievable for the quality and the picture.
"Not much to dislike about this great TV. 
Wonderful price makes it affordable enough to buy multiples.
For me, I think the best thing would be the easy setup."
"Simple review: The order for the TV was the least expensive, Hisense-$298 and delivered like in a flash as promised. Router cam quickly for the internet hookup (as promised). Easy to buy Easy to arrive and hook up. Bravo Walmart!"
"I loved the way my tv was delivered.  The couple pulled up, as I was at the mailbox.  They were so personable, and attentive. I appreciate the new way of delivering. It can't get any better then that???? We'll see. Thank you Walmart 😊."
"The sound is great. Picture is adequate. 

Annoying things: the cord is pretty short. Same length as the tv. Have to add an extension cord to it. Also sleep settings aren’t really customizable. Roku tv is cool though. Overall a decent buy."
"I wish i could leave a review about the actual brand/TV...however, I havent had an opportunity to even use it--as it was delivered like this. i also took a picture but of course the file is too large to upload."
"Item arrived a day later than expected but was in perfect condition.  Setup went quickly and most of my previous Roku channels transferred after logged onto site.  Color and sound are good for me. First time for this brand, so far so good."
Great TV for the price.  Easy to use and lightweight (easy to hang).  The free channel options are endless.  Time to cut your cable and just pay for what you watch.
It totally changed the way I watch TV. I'm able to customize what I watch and when I watch. I'm able to pause shows or watch same one  as often as I'd like. Great experience
"Hello, I consider the tv to be good, however the Roku system is extremely limited, NOT a web browser to surf the internet. In these times the browser is essential."
The speed of delivery was excellent. Was a Christmas gift to my sister and husband. They say the picture and sound is unbelievable!! Couldn’t be happier!
"Good size and features for the price.  The Roku interface is just a bit slower and glitchier than the Streaming stick, but not too bad.  Picture and sound are also decent.  Happy with the purchase"
"Tv was delivered on June 4th and it has already gone out. Not to mention I barely use it.  Total piece of JUNK!!! I’ve never had a tv, let alone a new one go out within 6 months. I’m highly upset!!!"
The screen/picture off mode is great for listening to meditation videos without the distractions of anything else. I love this setting which is also a setting my Sony TV had.
Exact size that I needed for the space and very good sound quality that is more out the front than the back!! Very good. The only downside was no voice on Roku remote 😟
This TV was a great purchase.  the quality of the picture is great. thw sound is perfect.  It was easy to assemble.  the price was affordable.  The TV was delivered two days earlier than expected.  I am fully satisfied with my purchase.
ive had this t.v less than a year and was very happy with it until this morning and the picture went almost black and not showing good.i have no idea what's happening here.
"I was very satisfied with my purchase of a tv but instead of getting just one,I got two.I was'nt too happy but you guys got right on it and refunded as promised thank you"
Merry Christmas to me 🎄this is my 4th tv of this brand. I bought this one for family room and it’s GREAT!!! I’ve stayed with brand cause I’ve had good results. Pic is bright n beautiful and no issues with sound. It’s all good👍🏼👍🏼
The manger telling me that they checked me out without giving me my items. Then been rude. If you have not place the item in the person car way check them out.
Mines was malfunctioning lines going thru the tv ………..I want to buy another one so bad but I’m scared of going thru what I went through the first time 😤just want my home to look nice for the holidays …but every thing else was great
"Very good price, picture quality is very good and the Riki OS is awesome, we have 3 Hisense TV’s and a Sony we paid almost 5k, Hisense TV’s picture quality is comparable."
"I love this television, however, the HDMI ports are in the middle of the television, and when it is hung on the wall it is EXTREMELY hard to reach. I wish the ports were on the side or bottom of the television, then it would be perfect!"
Bought this on sale for a nice Christmas gift for my mom never read the reviews gave it to her early and was so embarrassed for her to open and turn on an the screen is broken
"Had it shipped, but the screen had been broken. It was crackled and buckled up on the front side of the screen, so disappointed. Pick it up in a store, dont ship it to your house."
"This 58"" TV may be the best TV we have ever purchased.  The color is great, and it is a perfect size. Only time will tell the longevity of this TV, but at the low price of under $300. it almost becomes a disposable item."
"When the Roku logol is displayed the screen is bright in the middle but darker on each end and on the top and bottom. To get the picture I need the brightness must be set at the highest level and the temperature at Vivid. I may have to return it. The sound is very good. I don't need it above 20 to hear it well. The spoken work needs to be clearer though. I use Subtitles in case I miss some words. 
I'm 73 with vision and hearing issues. This TV meets most of my needs but when I have to run things at maximum I don't think it will last. Still a good deal for under $300 though"
I am old and I am having a hard time getting the channels I prefer and watch. I can't get the main ones I like. The T.V. itself is great. It has great Color. I don't like the small remote. I can't read it very easy. I did not get any paper work with it and I don't know what the buttons are for on the Remote.I don't recommend it for old people. We don't have much to choose from.
"The purchasing experience was a little bumpy, but after receiving a replacement due to one being DOA. Another almost not being delivered, because of address conflicts. Now having the TV mounted and calibrated, must say very impressed with picture quality, especially at this price point. Yoni, Walmart Customer Service Agent, went above and beyond to rectify the situation, thank you."
This is the second Hisense TV I've bought from Walmart. The picture is great and this one is a smart TV which to my surprise is very easy to use. The only thing I wish it was on a swivel base like my previous one .  I ordered online Saturday night and it was delivered FREE the next day !!!
"Buyer BEWARE!!! TV broke within 24 hours. I bought this TV in the store on October 13, used it that evening and the screen stopped working the next day October 14. So disappointed. I have had this brand before and felt that it was a good purchase, however, now I am very hesitant to ever buy this brand again. I would not risk it."
My screen was broken
Super easy setup! Sound is great! Not real sure of the color. It may be just because the color in our tv was going out and I was use to bad color. Shipped FedEx and was NOT damaged. Price was under $300 for a huge TV. So overall happy with this purchase!
"This is not a new TV as advertised! There were missing screws in my package, the foam broken, the TV was clearly unboxed before with the power plug scrapping the screen, remote or the TV stands not in any plastic covering, screws missing and the remaining ones just thrown in the big package, some random item (a copper ball) that doesn't belong in a TV box. This item can't be replaced either. Customer service after about two hours on the call said my only option is to box it back up and return it, and order a new one (which may be another used TV) online or in store. Walmart shouldn't label this as new if they don't plan on delivering brand new items. Also, the warranty link (one-year warranty from Hisense) under this product does not exist."
Very good quality
"At this price point you have to compromise somewhere. I´m well aware TVs on this size are $100 - $200 more, and even more if you go for Sony or something fancy. 

I needed a cheap but good TV for my living room, this is the only TV I´ll have in quite some time but at the same time didn´t want to spend big bucks on a high end TV so I went for this one. I´ll be using it to watch streaming and do gaming on a PS4 console.

The TV arrived well and on the timeframe expected, I had it delivered by FedEx and the guy helped me to get the TV up to the third floor where I live, no bad reviews in that regard. The TV came well packaged so I proceeded to install it, just a couple of screws on each of the 2 legs the TV have. After that that´s it. I turned it on, I connected it to the internet, since I already had a Roku stream stick it was pretty familiar, but even without this prior experience you will find it easy to configure. After that I think it downloaded some update and that was it. Added the 3 or 4 streaming services I had and done.

The TV does have some light bleeding on the edges: when the screen is all black you can see some lighter parts close to the bezel, but it´s not that bad like I have seen in other brands like Insignia, and when you are watching a dark movie/tv show it doesn´t bother at all, it´s not even noticeable, it´s just something that you see if you are looking for it on the Netflix loading screen.

Sometimes youtube skips a little bit when you rewind videos, but I can´t tell for sure if it´s not because my internet speed.

I liked that it has A LOT of configurations for each input and for each streaming service. I configured the Dolby audio and Dolby video while using Netflix and it didn´t affect the other channels, I´m not 100% sure I like this, since I have to configure each streaming service to have the same configuration, but so far is not needed. As I said, I just wanted to watch TV without a extremely bad TV and this one is a pretty decent one.

So, yes, I would recommend this TV for someone that is looking for a decent screen at a decent price. This is not an OLED screen, this is not a high end screen, this is not a Sony.

This is an overall good TV, on a correct price range with A LOT of configurations for the aficionado. Probably no one will use all this image settings, this alpha, this gamma, this color temperature, but if needed you have them.

PS4 also looks nice, and I even connected it to my work´s Macbook pro, and it´s much, much better than the actual monitor I´m using on my desk, I was able to use its 4k capabilities with crisp definition for working with coding and terminal/PHP storm.

So, yeah, go ahead, I don´t think you will be disappointed when you have in mind you paid $300ish dollars for it.

I´ll say it´s event better than my old LG TV which I also liked.

Nice TV for streaming, gaming (on PS4 at least) and even some work."
Extremely low quality for a TV claiming to be 4k. The quality on this barely is comparable to 1080p HD.  I incorrectly assumed because it is a ROKU that it would be comparable to a TCL Roku. The system format is similar but the picture quality is NOT.
""
"Love the picture quality and vibrancy. The free TV and movies available via the ROKU channel are a nice bonus since I don't have a cable TV subscription.  The only reason I do not give this TV a 5-star rating is that the speakers/sound is completely average.  We have an A/C unit close by which makes it difficult to hear sometimes. I purchased a sound bar to supplement it with awesome results!! I feel like I am in a movie theatre.   I would recommend this TV to a friend, colleague or family member."
"Complete waste of money! Bought this TV in June 2022 - no sooner the return date expires - the TV screen legit quits working. Audio works but the screen does NOTHING! Contacted Wal-Mart, they did nothing but tell me to contact Hisense. Emailed Hisense 2 weeks ago and have called them numerous times since and NOTHING! $300  completely wasted!"
Hisense worst product ever horrible service. lots of problems. no help from Hisense TV or Walmart. I purchased this TV last year. I have had nothing but problems from just a few months after purchasing it. I could not get any help from Walmart so I contacted Hisense they give you a year warranty. I've had problems all year long with this TV they never once offered to replace it or send a technician they just asked me to reset my TV and unplug it and do this that and the other thing they requested. I never got a call from anyone of authority. everyone I spoke to could not make decisions. they took plenty of notes but did nothing to help me. I got a young man on the phone recently I think his name was Justin at Hisense he told me I should be getting a refund due to all the problems I've had. someone called a few days later said I would not get a refund and they had no authority they were just to representative this was one problem after another with this TV I was strung along all year with no assistance from Hisense or Walmart. I was forced to recently file a complaint with the attorney general. I'm going to take further action until they give me a refund. if not they will continue to receive bad feedback all over the internet. TV had black screens freezing no picture but sound this would go on and off happen every once in awhile and other issues with remote and more I did with Hisense said the TV would work for a short time and problems would come back. by not assisting me tells me they just ran out my warranty. they have no interest in helping the customer. research it thoroughly before buying from Hisense. Hisense is a very bad quality TV with very bad customer service. all they do is argue with you make you mad and don't help you. I will also be contacting the better Business bureau not sure they could do much but I am going to put the word out all over this place. buy a good TV research Hisense because they make other TVs and do not purchase any TVs or products made by Hisense. if you do you will more than likely have nothing but problems. they are constantly hanging up on me when I ask for a supervisor. approximately a week ago before they said they would help me smoke started coming out of the TV I used the fire extinguisher and brought it out to the curb then I get a call they said anyway that they called and wanted to give me a refund only if I send the TV back well it's a little late for that now isn't it. all this fighting over a lousy $315 to a multi-billion dollar company. really that's like me giving two cents to a homeless person it wouldn't hurt me at all. they just choose to be bad bad. I can't tell you anymore other than do not buy their products. read the reviews all over you will see what I mean. spread the word tell your friends and family do not buy Hisense.
Love it perfect size!
"I have only had this tv for 9 month before it stopped working.  I do not have the original packing materials or box, so the 1 year warranty is voided.  I did all the resets and hacks, nothing worked.  The picture went to vertical lines at first ( colored and black and white).  Then it went to a black screen. There is no volume as well.  I am very disappointed in this product."
""
Clarity
"worst customer service with hisense. honestly I have always been a sanyo person myself but that price was very tempting. To be honest it worked great for 3 months and then it gave me these awesome vertical color bands that cover the whole screen. tv is useless. i left it unpluged for a few days thinking this might help. still did not help. so Hisense has 7 day tech support so i called them on the weekend. after 39 minutes of ""try changing the batteries in your remote to see if this fixes the problem"" or something else like try a different outlet (I did try this one for fun) i was finally connected to a person who asked would it be ok for me to send them some pictures of the tv issue. sent video of it powering up as well as pictures to a text they sent me. they text again and asked could i send them a picture again. heard nothing from them since.  Called them again during the week got a quicker answer this time this time i got to listen to dogs barking in the background while we talked (to be fair he had to listen to my kids in the background seemed like a fair trade)he said he would send me an email and to respond with pictures of tv(again), serial number sticker and receipt. that email never made it to me. went to Hisense website and sent an email including all this information name, address, ect. ect. to service@hisense-usa.com thinking maybe this would help. nada not even an automated email response. if you do purchase this TV definitely get the extended warranty as dealing with hisense is a little less than awesome."
"This Television was so easy to set up and connect.

I am a 66 year old female and I set this television up myself.  The setup was so simplified.

It is light weight and the picture is so sharp and clear.

I got this television on sale for an amazingly reasonable price.  And when I say this television was way under priced, it's true.

Thank you Walmart for a great sale!!!!!!"
Received TV and the screen was cracked all over I called Walmart and they said they could not help me unless I brought it in I told them I was disabled due to having a broken leg that's why I had it delivered to the house I even talked to the manager Scott.
I ordered a TV for my dad at 9:00 in the morning he had the TV delivered by noon same day but the TV ended up being too big so we returned it which was very easy Walmart provided everything the only negative thing to say about this is that I still haven't got my refund
I received the first tv after ordering it on line. It was damaged big time. Then I went to my local store and got a refund and purchased another one just like it. One note: when ordering this tv the description stated that it was’nt available at our local store when actually they said they had a wire house full in back of the store! I plan on ordering another one just like it!
I like my tv
i was disappointed with the services of this one particular item even though people that i talk to tried to help me in every way they could the job still didn't get done. so i am still without a tv set that should have been here four days ago. guess i should get it eventually. smh.
"Great TV. Our first one got smashed with a flying wii remote but we loved it so much we bought another just like it. Works well and has good sound and really let’s you get your bang for the buck. Fairly inexpensive, but good quality sound and picture with excellent connectivity. Definitely would recommend."
"This TV is excellent value and delivers a beautiful picture and easy Roku interface.  I haven't bought a TV in 10 years.  At first, I bought this as a gaming monitor for the kids, and when I saw how much better it was, I bought 2 more (one 65 inch and one 58 inch) to replace our older sets.  We've had them for a few months now and they are all getting plenty of use and holding up well.  Picture quality is as good as anything else I've come across.  I briefly had 2 new Toshiba Fire TV sets, but returned them because the picture quality on HD signals was so much better on the Hisense unit.  The Roku interface is easier and not nearly as buggy.  When scenes fade to black, the screen looks BLACK as though it were off.  Bright scenes in a dark room sometimes make me want to reach for a pair of sunglasses.  We are using these TVs for streaming, legacy satellite (which I'll probably get rid of now), and PC gaming which all work perfectly well.  The sound is better when you attach an add-on surround system, but only one of the sets in our house has this and no one is complaining.  Unless you are a picky connoisseur videophile, I would not hesitate to select this TV."
"So pleased with my purchase! This was a birthday gift for my husband. It was delivered in less than 24 hours!!! When I gave it to him he was so surprised! Excellent picture quality, great sound, everything you would want out of a Smart 4k tv! Couldn't be more satisfied."
Great deal easy set up!
"So a few mknths ago I bought this Hisense 58 inch Roku TV. I bought this having never heard of or seen a Hisense TV or ROKU. For $298 I didnt just get a 58"" TV, I got a monster of a Smart TV. Dolby Vision, Dolby  Vision for gaming, HDR , HDR   , and so many other bells and whistles, I dont even know where to start. I guess I could strt by saying I am speechless. I am ashamed, I feel as though all this for 298, I feel as though I have ripped Walmart off. I should have paid more for such a beautiful TV. Playing my Xbox Series X on this beast is amazing. It js so stunning. Roku TV, boy am I i. Lressed with Roku too. Being an Android TV fanboy for a few years, I have been proven wrong Roku is by far more feature rich, and most of all, the applications are a heck of a lot more responsive then Android TV and way more stable. If you are wondering if you should buy this TV, dont  bother thinking about it any more. Out this ba h jn your cart and click buy. You will not be disappointed. To thise who are like well it isnt varible refresh rate or it doesnt support 4k 120 hz well. You wont even notice this. First off, there really arent any games thag even hit that and second why pay sooo mich more when for 298 you get all this. i love this TV!!! pS it does support 1080p 120 hz/fps and it is stunning... Toss i  Dolby Atmos and some DTS and WOW!!!!!!"
"This TV only lasted 5 months before it broke and had lines running through the entire picture. Mfg states they have a 1 year warranty, HOWEVER, to use the warranty you have to email pictures, then a technician comes out to ""break"" your TV and "" they will ship another"" in about 2-4 weeks, so you will be expected to wait 2-4 weeks without a TV, then after waiting you may find out it's no longer in stock so then they will supposedly refund you after that time has passed. STATY AWAY FROM ANYTHING HISENSE WHICH IS OWNED BY VIZIO."
""
"I've had the TV for a few weeks now and love it! The Roku system is really easy to use and has a lot of opportunities for customization that I'm not used to. The quality of the picture is also excellent, and I have not encountered any issues. Highly recommend!"
TV is large and clear the only issue I have is having to use two remotes. I can turn it on through my cable box remote but I know where to put it on the cable box setting I need to use the TVs remote and then everything else will work with my cable box remote from there on. Also when I pause it and restart it there is no sound until I hit the pause button again

Ordered this item online was delivered today I took it out of the box got it set up and the screen was cracked highly upset about that returned it to the store to get another one but the one I bought wasn’t in stock and was told it would take 3 weeks to get a replacement so I had to get a smaller one which I don’t think is fair to me never even got to watch the tv was delivered damaged
"I have loved my new Roku TV since my purchase on 2/22. However, today on 10/2/22 the screen went completely black. I done all of the troubleshooting measures I could find,  but nothing helped.  I haven't even had it a year. And most of the articles I read was about a black screen, so obviously this isn't a new issue!"

Bought this 58 inch Hisense for a bedroom. Our other TV's are Samsung QLED but we didn't want to spend a thousand bucks for a new 60 inch. This Hisense TV gives you great bang for your buck with both decent picture and sound--richness of color tones is the only noticeable difference--color does not show as brilliant or crisp as on our Samsungs but it's still good. The ROKU OS interface is actually more user friendly and easier to navigate than Samsung's Tizen OS and the Hisense setup and streaming were both a snap! There are 4 slots for legs placement at 2 different lengths that will allow you to place the 58 in TV on a stand as small as 25 inches long. This TV offers you good value with price for the size
"Bought one. Delivery for Friday.  It was late. Delivered on Monday. Okay fine, that's okay. Screen completely cracked from corner to corner. Returned to store. Bought another for in store pickup. Arrived at store on pickup date. Walmart associate describes internet issue and that all the walmarts in the area were having problems and that they didn't have the TV in stock. No help really just told to cancel the order and kick rocks. Just ordered another. 

Very dissatisfied at this point."
"This arrived broken. It's really frustrating because you have to unpack it, set it up only to turn it on, go through the process of setting up with Roku just to learn its broken. These televisions are poorly made, they are hard to handle because you have to grip them without touching the screen, which makes it hard to take out of the box, also this arrives in FedEx and they didn't use a special cart. Plus the smart TVs I've noticed always seem to be problematic within a year because the computers overload and they start jamming, I think it's better to just buy a normal TV and add Roku attachments through HDMI even though it's a nightmare dealing with the remotes."
We had never heard of the Hisense brand before but decided to buy it anyways.  So far we love it!  Nice picture and sound and the price was great.   I am glad we went to the store to purchase instead of online like we almost did because it was $50 cheaper!  All in all we are very please thus far.
"Okay it really sucks for the people who got their TV cracked out the box... But whatever. Mine came, helped the delivery driver bring it up the stairs. Was worried based on the reviews I might crack the screen unboxing it. It was totally fine... This TV is awesome and has all the features I wanted. my only complaint is the remote is slightly laggy which is annoying compared to my fire stick but the interface is better. All in all this TV is awesome and it is a great deal. I am in love with it. I did spend the 30 bucks on the 3 year protection plan just in case but it's 30 bucks who cares. This TV is awesome and a steal. 1000% recommend."
"Awesome, affordable TV! Roku makes it easy to operate it. High image quality. Intuitive USB connection for pendrives. Fast internet speed. I just wished I could download apps from Android platform. I am glad I bought this TV and didn't fall for other similar quality, but more expensive brands."
"This is not my first Hisense tv (and I'm sure will not be my last) I have two others that are bit smaller which I purchased at Walmart about 5 years ago and they are still working great. When the TV in my living room (TCL) went out I went back to Walmart for another cheap TV. I originally bought the 50"" Onn (which is Walmart's own brand) but returned it shortly after because I did not like the picture no matter how many adjustments I made and there were squiggly lines throughout picture that came and went. So I got this 58"" Hisense instead - and I am so pleased with it! The picture is great and the sound is great and the price is great! If this is your budget or you are looking for the most bang for your buck you can't go wrong with Hisense."
"I prefer Smart TVs that are fairly stupid. I don't like all the auto adjustment bloatware on the expensive TVs. 

My last Hisense picture started failing after 3 years. So I bought another one. This because these are quite good for such a low $278 price. 

The picture out of the box had to be adjusted to my liking. 

Hisense sound is quite good. So much so that for my last Hisense I bought a 5.1 sound system and ended up returning it because it was just too much and I didn't like the sound of voices coming from below the TV. On Hisense the speakers are on the back of the unit and centered vertically and horizontally. So, the voices come right from the usual area of the picture.

The Roku remote is as always simple and intuitive. It is the only remote for the TV. One difference between this remote and the Roku Stick remote is that this one is optical and the Stick remote is wireless. So, for this Hisense remote, I must point it directly at the TV.

If I get 3 years out of this one, that will amortize to about $8 per month.  And after 3 years there may be new technology that I will be interested in.

So, spend the big bucks for Sony or Samsung and be proud, or get a Hisense and be stupid smart."
"Awesome. Quality awesome price. This is the best tv to buy. It has a huge frameless design and the resolution quality and being a smart TV it's the best decision that I have made. 
You will be extremely grateful and happy if you buy this television. Wint regret it at all."
Great picture and sound. I love all the apps that are available. Several free move apps like crackle and tubi. It also has the Starz app. Several other televisions I looked at do not offer the Starz app. Just a awesome television all around. I purchased 2.
"The tv overall is ok. We’ve had it for 6 months now. The picture is great. The remote seems like it takes a minute to connect to the tv, like there’s a pause before it’ll work (this goes for volume control as well), and recently after I open an app and get it going it will randomly crash and sends me back to the Roku menu, which is getting super annoying. Our other Roku TV doesn’t do that and it’s way older than this one."
Great Picture. Easy to set up. Excellent price/
We have only had our tv set up for 2 months and one day we turned the tv on to use it and the screen was black. Completely useless.
The order and pick up process was easy I've had the TV a year and it works great I would highly recommend excellent TV at a great price.
One week old and we are having trouble turning the TV on. It takes a few tries and then a double click on the remote.
i absolutely love this tv. the picture quality is amazing and the functionality of the tv is also an amazing feature for it.
I am impressed with ordering and the quick delivery. The delivery person was very polite and accommodating! Kudos to him!!!
Hi! This Tv was great at first it hasn’t even been a year and it already went out no picture just sound
"Read reviews 1st, especially about not touching or squeezing screen when removing from packaging, and peel plastic tape"
I love this TV. It moves flawlessly. No delays or loading issues. It's also big enough for me to see the screen. No complaints.
"didn't think I'd ever like anything but samsung. I was wrong this is one of my favorite TV.  great sound, clear picture and at a reasonable price."
Absolutely love this TV. It was super easy to set up and connect all the services to. Beautiful picture and sound quality.
I bought this tv for my mom for Christmas and she’s loved it. It has a few issues but we solved them pretty quickly.
I bought this TV 5/9/22. Everything was good until today 4/20/23 no longer works. Good luck on this purchase.
"This tv is so beautiful and thin. It has a great picture, sound and free streaming for HBO, RedBox, Apple TV (for 3 months), and more."
It’s blinking off on its own and returning to Home Screen on its on. The picture is blurry and in clear.
great product picture is awesome plenty of sound to even listen to my music highly recommend this TV
It's been months now and I still aren't heard anything they shipped my tv to the wrong house and I been looking around for it.
"i like that it was package well, The dislike is that u the audio is not that good on this tv Everything else is great. I gotta deal for this T.V."
"This TV is the first one I have ever bought for myself!! The picture is clear, nice colors, and easy to set up"
"Upgraded teen room and she loves it! Picture shows amazing, volume are very loud and the price I paid for a 58in was
Phenomenal"
Very nice tv. Easy to set up and get familiar with. Has just about every app available on one device also with live tv!
"I like that you don't need to purchase other equipment to use with the television, to get services like Netflix or Disney."
"I have not had any problems and I  like the TV,  just want to see how it works in years to come.    but its great now"
Great value for your money. The picture and sound quality are top notch in its price range and size. Overall a great purchase.
"I liked the size and the fact that it's a ROKU
So easy as far as streaming goes. I'm delighted with this purchase,"
I only had it a couple of weeks but so far so good nice picture the surround sound is terrific
I like every thing about It.!!! Yesaaaaaaa
I like the size and I like the fact that had Roku on my TV
Good price great picture quality easy to set up
Great value. VERY nice Tv for the money. We are very satisfied.
I love this tv so much and the apps are amazing
Great price and high quality products. Roku included. High quality sound
I love my tv but I just took it out the box and it got a crack in it
The screen went out right after the warranty expired.
just opened and broken screen out of box
"Bought twice both had to return twice, screen was broken right when it was taken out of the box"
"Good picture.
Everything worked as advertised.
Love it!"
I love this tv
"Bought it last February and hasn’t made it a year , screen out of nowhere blacks out I can hear everything but picture is gone looked around the internet and it seems this and other hisense tv black out because of many reason next time I’ll look at the reviews"
it took long enough to at least complain there is no place to say I ordered gluten-free pie crust three boxes and I got three boxes of regular pie crust so I think it sucks and how do I get rid of it how do I make this right how do you make this right
"TV is ok. Remote is garbage. Either buttons don't work when they're supposed to, or they double-click when you don't want them to, or the remote just stops working randomly. I've had the TV for only a couple months, there's no reason for this when my actual previous Roku unit that's no longer supported and is so old it has a Blockbuster button, worked for well over a decade. The new remote is also infrared, instead of radio wave, which means it requires line of sight like a ""regular"" TV remote and not like what you remember from an old Roku where it just works anywhere in a room, even pointed away from the TV."
"Works well, easy set-up.  Great picture and sound"
Very easy to use and great picture.
"The picture quality is very good, the sound is excellent,
 and it was priced right."
Beautiful picture. Easy to set up. Love it love it love it❣️

"This is my second Hisense tv. I purchased the 39"" years ago. Both tv's are excellent for the money!"
Good deal overall but lacking input/output versatility for surround sound etc

Good size tv for a good price. You can't go wrong.
Easy set up and great picture!
Love this tv. Excellent deal
it exceeded my expectations in all categories. setup took awhile and the protection plan was very reasonably priced. great picture
Person couldnt pick up item because i didnt check in on email and i wasnt on my phone at the time to do it so they couldn't get it
The driver had to drop the tv I plugged it in and the screen is totally ruined
I really love the picture quality I like how all my apps hook up really fast and the price was awesome
"This TV is unavailable, I purchased the 5 yr protection plan, trying to get it cancelled!  Bunch of trouble."
I brought two sets and it's easily one of the best deals and experience I ever had with a product...
TV is great! Thought it would arrive sooner. Could have picked up one at local store faster. I was just too busy.
Great tv for the price. Great picture. For the size it is light in weight. Plenty of hdmi ports. Easy to set up.
I ordered this TV on line. It is damaged and unusable. Returning would be terribly difficult.  What a waste
This tv is quick to respond (on/off). The picture quality is great and the Roku integration is flawless.
Amazing TV for the price. It was provide as a replacement for a cheaper one ordered online...great image quality and slim look
"The TV is a great buy, but make sure you check your receipt cause they throw in a little charge that they don't tell you,it's recycling fee,"
I had the TV sent to my mom out of state. They noticed that the screen was cracked when they removed it from the box. It was never turned on.
I liked that it was really easy to set up. It's really easy to maneuver thu the settings. And all around easy to use.
Do not like the remote control options. No channel selector. You have to scroll through each channels.  Not as nice as my last 58 inche TV.
"Great TV for the value, the Roku OS is easy to use and with the phone App the TV becomes voice controlled."
I am an I didn't look behind  the tv found 😳 everything I was looking for I gotten work on me honestly
Great picture but not enough base in the volume could use some improvement in that area but overall Great buy VERY HAPPY ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE.
"Nice picture, seems bigger than the stated size. Delivered quickly. Great deal, even without a ""special"""
"Value Excellent Great Picture Quality Ease of Operating Features 
Plenty of preloaded Apps Best TV I have ever owned"
"These tvs are great! It’s our 3rd Hisense tv now, the clarity and quality of these TVs are awesome. Felt like the game was in our living room."
easy to use. sound was ok but bought a sound bar for better noise when using spotify on the tv or loud movies
"I live the television, and the picture is fantastic, but need to have both remotes to get to my tv service."
"I don't have no dislike, my TV is very nice,  picture quality is awesome,  volume is great, it's really a good buy."
owned a hisence tv for10 years happy for the service it has given us. Hope the new hisence tv serves us as well
I love this TV!!!!!!!!!! It is super amazing! And the quality cannot be beat! I want to buy one for my mom!
The picture quality is amazing. It was easy to set up and it is almost instant on when I turn it on.
Just bought the tv and has bubbles on the screen now have to go through the hassle of having to return it
I haven’t had any problems with our Rocky smart TV and enjoy how easy it is to get around to different channels
"The Roku system is slow and do not keep it up with the content. it takes some time to get the proper resolution with Netflix, for example."
TV is great no problems with it.  Only thing is it shows it comes with 2 remotes on the box but there is only a simple remote
Awesome TV easy to set up and great picture. ROKU attached to my home network and we are ready to go
"I want to love the tv but the tv didn’t come with screws for the TV stand.. can’t return it, can’t find the screws, I’m at a loss."
"Shipping is very quick, and the price is bank for your buck.The shipping is great improvement compare way back a year or two ago."
"very happy with this roku set up!, So easy, plug it in, and watch! I waited for this price to come down. Very affordable!"
I purchased a tv 5 or 6 months ago and just took it out of the box and it is damaged.  I want a refund!
"Great value, hard to fully judge because still new, if it last 3 or more years then it would be 5 stars"
We bought this TV to replace an older LG. We like the Roku system. We are using the TV with a Hisense soundbar. It is a great TV for the price.
I love this TV.  I have no issues with it. The picture is very clear and bright.  My mom feels like she can touch the people on it. LOL!  Thank you
This TV fits the space I have perfectly. Great sound and color and the picture is very clear. Great price for a great TV
this tv lasted less than a year. Vertical lines started appearing on the screen. Customer service is subpar
I only had this tv a year and 2 weeks and I moved it and it stopped working!!! The screen won’t come on now.
"You literally cannot get a tv with Dolby vision anywhere else for this price. It could obviously be better, but not for the same price."
"This delivery was perfect , box was upside down but no damage to tv at all !!!!! Excellent for the proce works perfect!!"
"I’ve had this tv less than 3 months, only used 2 and nothing streams. When you go to play something it’s just a black screen."
Great TV for a great price. Nice features really nice picture. Fast delivery. Roku works great for me. Easy and fast.
"Great tv with roku interface, (fast interface, better than 6 series Roku in my livingroom.  Best remotes for roku.  Also great picture."
"TV didn't last a year in the master bedroom. Got the black screen of death, audio and no video. If you have any sense, stay away from Hisense."
"Needs to allow more apps. VidAngel is one we use a lot to edit movies and TV shows, but Roku stopped allowing it for some reason."
TV came to house...BROKEN...I never received it off the delivery truck. I am STILL being charged for it thru AFFIRM. Please fix this problem.
Love this TV! Great picture quality and the price is so affordable. I have three of these in my house and will always buy Hisense.
super easy to order ........ and i am not an internet shopper. easy tracking and it was at my door in less than 48 hours!
Great for one year. Now as many others have mentioned there are flashes of horizontal lines across the bottom
"the Roku TV by Hisense was easy to set up, has good sound and picture quality. it is very easy to use and I have had no concerns or problems with it."
"great TV for the price.  love the size and features, especially the Roku built in.  very impressed with the picture quality."
"I purchased the tv fory mom. When opened it was cracked.  I returned the tv by FedEx,  walmart did not report return to Affirm. The were still taking funds out my account."
It’s a great tv with only one major flaw. The only sound bar that’s compatible is a roku soundbar and the subwoofer that goes with it it flawed and doesn’t work.
"Like the delivery.  I bought it one day and the next day it was at home. I would prefer it if the screen were brighter, but everything works well. Easy to install and set up."
"very nice TV for the price. absolutely no issues setting it up and it uploaded updates pretty quickly. sound and picture are of great quality. if i needed another TV, i would buy this again."
TV was great until not even 4 months later it just randomly quit working. TV turns on and sound comes out but all you get is a blue screen. Have checked everything on it and there is no fix. Not even half a year old and I've wasted $300.
"Very pleased with my purchase. This tv has such a good quality when it comes to resolution and volume. It’s pretty big so make sure to measure your tv stand before you get one. It’s not too heavy, super slim and well packed."
"I’ve had my tv for 9 months now and it’s down. When we turn it on, there is all these colorful lines going down on the screen that you can’t see anything but the lines. I can’t find my receipt to call about the warranty."
took three deliveries to get one with out a broken screen...... and be warned you can not connect anything like speakers or sound bar unless ot is a Roku product.... wish i mever bought this tv
"Not sure if the TV is any good.  Ordered the first one and the screen was cracked, sent back.  Ordered the second and I'm almost positive it was the same TV, not even repackaged, cracked screen in the same place.  Do better Walmart"
"The TV was fine until a few weeks ago when the picture started to go very
fuzzy and broken lines across the screen...I need to know how to go about 
returning the TV...I will be calling the company Hisense...
Thank you CC..."
I personally love Roku Televisions. This TV was huge 58 inches seemed small in wirds but when I got it home it was much bigger than expected. Beautiful picture and great sound!
"have had this nearly 2 weeks now. the picture is great, sound is great. will update if something changes but its the best deal ive found for this size less than 300bucks."
"Great TV! Setup was a breeze, faster than a standalone Roku device. Having a single remote for all the functions is great as well, although there's no way to punch in an OTA channel number. You have to press up/down and go through them one by one."
"I expected a $338 tv to last longer than 8 months. The backlight comes on but there is only a black screen, and the remote inputs don't work. Walmart's response was to find a local tv repair service."
"Great price, been 2 weeks now . Surprised with the quality of the picture. It's Roku so I don't need the add on equipment for Netflix and, Utube etc……"
It shipped straight to my door for free and I didn’t have to worry how I could get it home since it would not fit in my car. Plus it was the lowest price around.
I order this same tv twice and they both were damaged in the screen area. So now I now I have wait again for Fexdex to come pick up the tv again and i have wait for another refund.
"I loved the sale price for a 58"" TV and it shipped sooner than expected.  I do not have it set up yet as just recently moved and waiting to see if my basement   stays dry enough to make a family room down there.  I am very pleased with my purchase."
Nice tv not the greatest picture but for the money it was better than expected.  A little complicated with the Wi-Fi setup at it would not take the password I had so I had to dumb it down a little bit thumbs up.
"Great tv, screen clear, easy connected to my devices. Great picture and sound !  Easy to use air play . Great price ! I would like to recommend this product !"
wirst tv ive ever bought.  i bought this gor my parents who live alone this tv it went bad in 5 months. if i were you i eouldnt buy this tv. i paid for a tv repair man and he said the screen went bad after he replaced the motherboard. be careful.
I bought the tv in February and used it as one normally would 8 months later it dies and turns out this company is notorious for their tv screens going black 😕
"Great deal! So many channels with wifi. You can binge watch most shows you like for free. 

Remote control is simple, but really good if you understand how to use it.
Has remote app as well.

Extremely satisfied with this purchase."
Arrived ahead of delivery date with no problems. Happy with purchase initially picture and sound fantastic. 8 months later screen black with sound and get factory reset to work as suggested.
Shipping was simple and fast.  Great price.  If you want an inexpensive 4k TV this is the way to go.  Best price I could find for58 inch TV.    Easy set up.   Good picture.
"The TV arrived on time and in good condition. hooking it up was easy, although I had my Granddaughter help me set it up. Picture is clear and bright. I would purchase this brand again."
"For the exact price of the tire, it does not have an excellent resolution and the music is a bit above the voices.  but, it is not the only model that happens to him because he had already noticed it.  So far no complaints."
"please, help me understand ""walmart"" , how could you send me a product / hisense 58"" tv , totally with  a crushed , spider wed crack screen ? the worst purchase i have ever made at Walmart !"
"Great picture. However, I've had the tv for about 2 months and there are white flickering lines on the bottom. Don't if it happened in the shipping or what and I can't exchange it. Sucks. Other than that the tv is great."
"ive had this tv not evrn a year, and today ut shut off and when i went to turn it back on the on button blinks but wont turn on?? can someone help please?!"
"Mute key is on side of remote.
Only 1 year warranty.
No number keys on remote to allow direct channel selection. Website does not make it possible to buy
product insurance after initial purchase."
screen had a large dent on the left side causing it to be cracked throughout.   not sure if it happened at the warehouse or on the fedex truck.   never even got a chance to turn the tv on
Great TV for the price...I would give it 5 stars but give it 4 stars because it's not 58 inches..It's 51 inches...Beautiful picture and easy setup...Fed Ex carried it into my front door...Great service..

Great quality and great price
It was very easy to set up
"The ease of use, you can set the picture to your taste."
Don't buy it.  I've only had this tv for a year and it's already not working.
"great tv, great picture. great price."
Tv didn't work when I bought it and it was cracked Walmart wouldn't give me my money back
I love my TV. Everything is clear
"nice TV, really good picture quality.  very happy with it."

clear!!!   Hard to setup with  DirectTv
Nice size TV for the price! And good volume. No problems so far
TV is less than a year old and picture went out! Warranty is not worth what they claim!
Tv lasted 5 months. Closes out of apps automatically.
works great and my cousins are very happy with it. it was easy to setup.
My husband loves to play his games on this tv. He says the quality is great
It has a great picture and sound
"Everything is awesome with my TV, I love everything about it, high. Five Walmart!"
Love the TV and it’s huge. Works great and worth the price. 😊
I love the TV…it was a reasonable price and nice quality in size and picture
"That's not me, I live in Pennsylvania, not New Jersey"
My 3rd purchase of à Hisense brand 4k tv. Easy to setup and operate. Beautiful picture and color.
My teenage son really enjoys it!
"Great value, works great."
The he delivery was on time and the driver was helpful in getting my Tv inside.

Too much technology.. was so hard for me to handle and deal with.
"This is a excellent tv for the price, nice and bright for the price.  You won’t finder a better deal for the quality and size cause this thing is huge!!!!!"
Tv was delivered today and I set it up this evening and it does not work.  Powers up but only a bunch of blobs and color lines show up.  Almost looks like cracked glass even though it is not glass. FedEx was the delivery company.  Very disappointed.
Ordered tv online from Walmart for $315. Tv image is broken. Walmart will not exchange. I have to return tv. The same tv is currently out of stock online with a price of $398. Im out time and money because of wal-marts customer service.
bought the tv monday today is wednesday and i have a black horizontal line through the television. I tried calling customer service but they were no help because nobody answered the line.
"This tv had a deal last Christmas that I couldn’t pass up on. I ended up buying 3. One for myself and 2 others as gifts. The TV overall has decent resolution and works great with no lags but after a year. I went to work one day and my tv wouldn’t turn on. I tried it all and nothing. I ended up having one of the other ones with me still since I gifted it to my boyfriend but we not live together. It worked fine until recently again. Are these tv meant to only last a year or so? Upon looking it up it’s pretty common I see.  I currently still have A brand new tv in the box unused from hisense(google not Roku) but I’m scared the same thing will happen.  Anyone know if this issue or it’s just my bad luck?  

The light does blink when the remote off and on button is pushed."
I loved this tv until the screen went black and it no longer worked. I ordered this online at the time it was much cheaper in price in mar of 2020 and here I am in oct 2021 without a tv. I did get the warranty from Walmart so at least I get what I paid for but I won’t be able to get the same tv at the price I originally purchased it for. It was good while it lasted but I have never heard of a tv going out in such a short period of time like the warranty is for four years but u learn n u live. I’d stick to more trusted brands because this one got me.
"Simple easy set up. We noticed 3 main issues in the first 3 weeks of using it... 1. The wifi would disconnect multiple times a day/week after turning off the tv. It was an easy fix since our network settings are saved so you just have to reconnect but it's still a strange thing to happen over an over again. 2. The audio cuts out and doesn't come back until you leave the app (i.e. Netflix) and then reload thecontent, it may do this a few times in a row. 3. The picture/color changed to a different setting without our doing so we went to the picture settings and switched it back. 

Separately,  this tv only comes with the Roku remote, it doesn't have the roku voice command, (bummer) but it's still really simple to use. You can add lots of apps, connect to your cable provider, or other devices... DVD player, apple tv, etc but keep in mind it only has 3 hdmi slots and 1 USB slot. We like it for what we need and at this low price point how can you beat that!?"
"Set up was super simple with all top streaming apps readily available. Picture is quite clear, only slightly less vivid than a new Samsung. Dolby audio is outstanding. No need for a soundbar unless you need extra bass, movie quality surround sound, etc."
"beautiful television I have never had a tv as nice as this the picture is unbelievably clear and being only 8 inches bigger than my last tv it looks so much more larger than that very happy with my purchase, I wish I could give a review for the worker who brought it out to me at curbside she was extremely helpful and pleasant I wanted to give her a tip but she said she is not allowed to accept tips that's really messed up Walmart you should let them particular people take tips they have an important and not so easy job change your policy."
"I recently purchased a 58"" HiSense Television, but the Roku Remote supplied did not support Voice Assistant, as advertised.
I opened a Resolution Case with Wal-Mart, and they PROMPTLY responded, by providing am amicable solution to the problem. A partial refund was offered, which was accepted. This is in lieu of returning the Television, for a full refund, but the HiSense is currently out of stock.
I salute Wal-Mart for their excellent Customer Service, and prompt resolution of the case."
Excellent price! Good refresh rate and the apps are quick. I love this tv. The colors are vibrant and the picture is clear. I have it paired with a Panasonic DP-UB9000P1K and the 4K movies look amazing. The HDR is nice and this 58” tv for the price is a steal. It’s light and easy to mount. I’m also a big fan of the ROKU over Amazon FIRE or other wonky apps services….
I love my 58in hisense rouku smart tv it is very large in size in fact to me it looks much bigger than a 58 it was easy to navigate through setting it up and very nice high quality color and I truly haven't found anything negative to say about it.great price to!
"If it hadn't DIED at 1 year old , would have given 4 stars.
Hisenseburg (SAY ITS NAME) 58R6E3 Was the biggest tv we've had,
Traded up ? up from a 40..
Picture was great , audio a little weak , 
roku remote worked good, but mine had no voice control   
ALL GOOD until black screen red light NO PICTURE assumed dead 
watched youtubes and wasn't able to apply any fixes 
Only 4 plug in boards under the hood, Didn't dig down to the LEDs
Gonna bring it to the ONLY TV repairman left alive"
"After my experience, I do not recommend purchasing a Hisense TV...I expected to get a good 5 or so years out of this TV before upgrading...but it kicked the bucket in less than 2 years. Its a beautiful TV and it never had any scratches, dents or bumps the entire time I owned it. Stayed put on the TV stand for its entire life. Fell asleep on my couch one night and woke up to my TV off. I thought maybe the timer kicked in or the power had went off sometime. Tried to turn it back on and all I got was a faint pulse of the logo screen and a rapidly blinking led light (see photo). I tried all of the fixes I could think of to no avail. In other words, the powerboard/motherboad died out of nowhere. Its more expensive to fix than buy a new tv. Even if I did get it fixed, whats to say it won't die again. Ive had friends tell me that their Hisense has died the same way. So I'm left with a glorified paperweight. Gonna just toss it out and get another brand in the near future. Or just get a dumb TV and buy a roku to hook up to it.

Gave it 2 stars because it did work and the picture was beautiful. But highly disappointed in the life of such an expensive tv."
Tv is decent great price got it on sale for $278 just under $300 with tax thats a great price for a 58inch tv. Ive had it for about 4 months now with no issues. Ease of use I would give it 9 out of 10 features I would give it 7/8 out of 10 I think the colors could be a little better and brighter but over all Im pleased. It looks great mounted on the wall
"I bought mine on dec 2019 it died on feb 2021 better buy some insurance on it, I did and at least  recovered $255 from the original price, I'll purchase some other brand, picture quality was ok considering the price, darks colors need more resolution"
"I just upgraded from a 5 year old 1080 insignia tv and WOW, this is a total difference. This thing is a BEAST too.

Remember, this is a budget tv but I was easily impressed since my previous tv was really low tier

I use it as a bedroom TV but this could easily be a main room tv. If you're looking to upgrade on a low budget. This one is perfect"
"Just bought this Hisense 58"" UHD TV on 12/14/21.  
Great price,  easy setup,  love the ROKU ( I have a Streambar attached).  
Color is awesome....so far, so good. 
Love the 58"" size...price of a 50-55"" TV, BUT much like a 60"" in overall experience.  A lot of TV for the $$$."
Blue Screen of death exactly 1 month after warranty expired you suck
Love the TV beautiful picture
my tv has a crack on it once i plug it up
delivery people was very good and nice thank you so much
I ordered 2 of these and they both only measured 50” across. I guess I didn’t read the reviews thoroughly because several other people mention this also. How they can get away with marketing this product as 58” just blows my mind. I won’t be buying this brand again.
"Day 1. Bad outlook.  Delivery was a day late.  AND they left a 58 in TV on my front porch. Didn't have to sign.  No knock on the door.  What if I wasnt home? 
NEXT
I set everything up and BAM the remote doesn't work. The darn TV doesn't have buttons so there is no way to even set it up WITHOUT a remote to get other remotes to function. Can't switch the hdmi to satalite or firstick. Walmart can only offer a partial refund or will replace/refund the TV. Hisense SAID they'll send out a new remote but that takes 3-5 days. 
THEN
I can't actually review the TV. Cause i can't WATCH the TV. Cause AINT NO DARN REMOTE to use the TV. IN ANNNNYYYY CAPACITY. 
I still don't know if the TV actually works. 
Run! Run Forest RUN!!! Hop on your bicycle and pedal fast and far away from this. 
Yea this might have to go back..."

Price and size
"Spent twice or three times to get a Japanese or Korean TV make sense if you have very picky eye sight. Or your wealth justifies double expenses for a little visual improvement most people can't tell. Or if you  just want to show off.
I am an average man with average eye sight. Some money in the bank but I'd like to spent it elsewhere to please me more. I want super quality contents a TV can bring but just good quality for the TV itself- A good story on a good TV is better than a so-so movie on a super TV. This TV with Roku is a good quality TV which brings the best to watch.
*Tip for making purchase based on product review: Eliminate those bad reviews caused by shipping damages. A TV malfunctions within a month is usually caused by damages incurred during shipping.
The second most likely of trouble occurs to people don't use a surge protected outlets for their electronics- Electrical surges reduce lifetime of electronics."
"I just got this 58"" Hisense 4K UHD Roku TV today. And I have a couple gripes already. One is the WiFi is a little sketchy. Twice in about 2 hours it mysteriously lost the connection. My WiFi Router is about 10 ft away, so this shouldn't be happening. It even shows in the TV's settings that the connection is Excellent. But with the WiFi only 10 feet away, I will just use a Cat 5 cable and connect the TV directly to the Router if it keeps cutting off the WiFi Connection. The second problem is the Picture Mode, like Normal, Movie or Vivid has changed itself twice in two hours to Low Power. I like the Normal setting. Low power makes the screen too dark in my bright living room. I am not sure if I could have caused it. I was doing all kinds of things with settings and trying out my laptop using HDMI. Watched a few minutes using Roku and Antenna TV. And the TV even shut off once because I was on the Roku home screen and hadn't picked an App to load fast enough. Likely 15 or 20 minutes. . And now there is a third problem. While the TV was on Antenna TV, the screen went black. Freaked me out. As I wasn't looking at the TV when it happened. So I pressed the top left button and the guide popped up for the app I was using. I picked the top channel in the app and the picture instantly came back. I don't know if it was the same channel that I was on. It shouldn't have happened. The picture is awesome. Even the sound is pretty good. It has everything I wanted in  a new TV.  But if it keeps glitching on me, I will return it. But there were no other TV's with all the features I needed and wanted at such a super low price, so I hope it starts working well. If it worked seamlessly, I would have given it 5 stars because everything else about the TV is great."
"The television was scheduled for arrival on Saturday and ultimately arrived on Sunday. More importantly, having set up the television, I have found there is about a 2  inch strip along all 4 edges, the picture is substantially lighter which is enormously distracting. I like the television in pretty much all other respects but that issue is obviously not acceptable."
"I am starting to believe that all of theses 5 star reviews are fake. I bought two TVs and one came busted up and the other was broken and I couldn’t even watch tv. I was thinking why would they send TVs out like that? So now I gotta return two broken TVs and it’s not fedex it’s hisense brand making these cheap TVs!!! Whoever tv is working it won’t wanna to too long, Warning I wouldn’t waste my time or money!!"
"So far so good! Bought for the 4K, HDR, and refresh rate for when I eventually upgrade to a PS5. For now, though, it looks great and plays great with the Xbox One. Was a breeze to set up and get all of our usual apps (Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Disney , etc.) running on. I bought this Hisense TV after having another Hisense Smart TV for the past seven years (that one is still running strong even though it is subjected to constant use and abuse by three kids and two adults!)"
"Walmart would not let me put the TV on the roof of my car.  Explained that if the Tv fell, Walmart would be blamed. TV was refunded. I wound up with two
TV's delivered to my home, with one Tv having a cracked screen.  Tv was returned to Walmart, and refunded. Everything seems to okay, once the money is returned to my credit card."
Seems to work ok. When I first got it the remote didn’t work so they sent a new one thankfully. But every time the TV turns on it flicks off and on jittery like for 6 seconds. I would like to know what to do because I just bought it and don’t like it doing that. Thank you.
I really like this TV with one exception. The sound is not very good on it. My other Hisense had sound issues too and I was hoping that this one would be different. Guess not. But I still would recommend this TV it has a large screen and a pretty good picture. I guess I will have to buy a decent sound bar for it.  I hope it lasts at least 5 years like the other did. The settings were easy to use and I absolutely LOVE the ROKU aspect of it. It works great with my WIFI too.
"Less than a year since purchasing and this television is already giving issues. For the last week when turning on this device after it’s been turned off for hours at a time, the screen is all botched on the home page with black rectangles covering most of the screen. I would never recommend this television to anyone for purchasing. I only gave it two stars because of the special pricing when I purchased it and the fact that once I go into an app that I’ve installed on the television, the botchiness goes away and only shows botched where the volume indicator is when adjusting the volume. But turn the tv off and turn it back on after awhile and tv screen is botched again. The sensor is not great either with the original remote. If it’s not pointing directly at the little red sensor reader, it won’t operate the tv, whereas if I used the Roku tv remote app on my phone, I can literally operate the tv from my phone from any room in the house without it pointing towards the tv and without pointing my phone towards the room the tv is located in. Highly disappointed and wish I could return this tv."
"This is our second Hisense television. We bought the 75"" version of this television for our basement family room in December, and absolutely love it. So when it came time to purchase a new TV for our upstairs living room, we immediately went back to the Hisense brand without even thinking twice.  We use AT"
"This TV itself is slow.  My older standard TV that had a Roku plugged into it was much faster at loading.  Old Tv click on Netflix and after 2 to 3 seconds it's open.  This Tv I click netflix and have to wait 10 seconds until it even changes.  Then once netflix is open it takes awhile to load the titles.  Even just scrolling through the titles is slow and clunky.  However once what ever title I start to play is actually playing, the Tv does a fine job of playing.  I'm just picky and want it to be fast and responsive."
"I bought this to replace a 50"" Hisense. We lover the old TV and decided  to try another one. The picture  quality was ok. The reason we return it, it would not let us use the Direct TV remote to control volume.
Hisense tech support was no help. Return it to Wal Mart, they were great."
"The price was certainly an effective come-on.  The screen size, picture and color all have been exquisite. The set-up was much easier and went more smoothly than I anticipated. Definitely a much-more-than-seems type of vibe going on.  The connections to Roku, my Amazon account and my Hulu account were made with very little effort on my part.  This Hisense TV is definitely smart. This was my first experience with smart TV set-up. The only question that came to mind was, ""Why did I wait so long?"" Highly recommend this remarkable"
"Very good TV for the money.  HDR10 and Dolby vision support on a sub $300 TV at 58"" is pretty impressive.  The only con on this TV is the edge light bleed.  You just have to remember that you are watching a TV that was less than $300 and keep things in perspective."
"Honestly the specs for the price were great. However mine came with some really annoying dead pixels. I traded it in for the same model hoping that would solve my problem. The second TV didnt have dead pixels but had a lot of light bleed around the edges. And I'm talking light bleed that bleeds into the picture, not light bleed that goes outside the TV. So I returned that one as well."
"just arrived today.on time, undamaged to the eye. So far, all a person can ask for!

I connected and watchedseveral shows on Comcast, Did a quick viewing on Amazon Prime, even connected it to my Google home!

Hopefully, it will continue to work for a long time. Ill report back in 45 days.

Great value!"
"Great value for a big screen Roku smart TV. This replaced a TCL 55"" Roku TV that died after less than two years (got full refund). This Hisense TV has a faster, more responsive interface than the TCL. The volume is also louder than the TCL.
I was also pleased that it is compatible with the Apple TV  app, which I did not expect.
I did buy the 4-year extended warranty just in case."
This is a good tv it works very well it has super good quality even for video games I don’t even have to turn it up a lot I get to like 10 volume and it’s load enough only thing they need to work on these TVs is were there’s a feature to disconnect it from your internet
"I love this TV! Its cheap for the size: a complete STEAL! Thank you Walmart! The quality is amazing. I waited weeks for this TV, it kept selling out near me. But Im so glad I have it now, perfect for the lockdown/quarantine! Definitely recommend. Only thing itsso big, it kinda makes gaming overwhelmingly."
I liked the product online. Checked reviews and the problem was delivery. Well i gave it a shot cause my fedex guy is the Best! Well my guy is good. Rang bell even called me. After all that got product and it was still broken. Put in for a replacement and was told it was out of stock. Maybe the company should use better packaging. Just a thought.
"Purchased my Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV HDR 58R6E3 online thru Walmart.com as it was not in stock at local Walmart store. Ordered on 12/11 and  delivered by Fedex on 12/18, it was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  it wasn't opened until Christmas Day a week later and setup 12/26.  Upon opening I was surprised the packaging was lightweight and skimpy compared to a 75"" TCL unit purchased a year before.  Upon simple installation of the base and setup, we discovered the screen was cracked effecting more than 1/3 of the screen.

Went online at Walmart.com to initiate a return, discovering a ""return and replacement"" option was available.  However, the return and replacement option failed with an error ""unable to process at this time.  Please try again later.""  3-days later and 20  attempts with the same result, I decided to return the unit to my local store.

In store return was quick and easy, although my careful repacking and re-taping of the carton was a waste.  Carton had to be reopened and inspected as part of the process.  No big deal.  Purchase price refunded to my credit card on the spot. 

Before leaving the store, decided to visit the electronics department, see what my options were to replace or by another brand.  After a courteous store associate related the same unit showed zero inventory but 4 units expected in 3 days, we found one of the same 58"" Hisense models mixed among other TV's in an aisle.  

I was apprehensive about buying another Hisense due to my own experience with the cracked screen and many other reviews about cracked screens.  Still needing a replacement I rolled the dice and bought another.  Unpacked it the next day at my daughter's and was stunned wit the improved packaging.  More packaging, better materials, stiffer screen protection particularly on edges.  This was a huge improvement over the first one.  Set it up and it was a great picture, no cracks.  Somewhere along the line Walmart's vendor reacted to all the complaints and fortified the packaging.  I'm betting recently manufactured units are packaged much better, like the 2nd one I purchased.  Cannot comment on long term durability of the product yet, less than 2 weeks into very good performance so far.  But give Walmart and Hisense some credit, the cracked screen issue has been addressed.  Packaging much improved now.  This low cost, high feature model into 4k UHD is a less risky purchase and Walmart will stand behind you."
"good value great picture...you will need to make adjustments to get the most from this TV. it can provide a great experience if your willing to put in the effort. My suggestion is to look to YouTube for recommendations to that end. loads of apps, roku TV is user friendly. sound is great...budget TV or not. best bang for the buck in my opinion."
"I read the reviews stating that their television was delivered broken so I picked mine up in the store. I got someone to help me, got it home, set it up, turned it on. Shattered! What the heck? I never considered a tv would be shattered before but considering how well it was packaged and how often people report it happening for this particular brand, I will go back to a better brand. It was a waste of my entire night picking it up, and having to take it back. Plus, Wamart isn't my favorite anyway."
"This television is perfect for our driveway football viewing. Smart with all of the streaming features that we required for easy setup week after week. Very lightweight because we need to store it indoors after we disassemble our tailgate viewing. The resolution is exceptional, even in outdoor lighting."
Its great in the beginning. Only had this TV since July of 2020. The functions no longer work. My tv takes forever to scroll or do anything on Netflix. Its not my internet because the tv in the bedroom works perfectly. Time to buy a new tv. Yay me. =[
It's not 120hz as advertised. It's only 60hz.
"Excellent tv, just much bigger than I expected."
This tv took tv viewing to a whole different level !
Box was damaged when it arrived...hope it works when my son gets it for Christmas
I do not want to return I'm satisfied with my order

You can't beat the size for the price. I have no complains about anything. when they deliver I was given a time and updates on the delivery.
This is like a Black Friday deal in august! $300 for a 58” smart.  This tv is great! I don't have to buy any extra items. I got it in one day.
The Hisense has a beautiful crystal clear picture light weight very easy to assemble the cost perfect I Love my Hisense
Not sure what to say. I only had the TV for a year and it. Just shut of and never turn back on again.
Arrived with screen completely broken. Had shipped due to having no way to transport it. Return has been a disaster.
"Hi sense is a very good brand of TV. The color is bright ,sound is good which makes TV watching very enjoyable."
TV's are measured diagonally.  Not horizontally.   I noticed some were complaining about the measurements.
The tv is a great product. The picture is very clear and the set up was very easy.  I am happy with my tv.
"Great TV for the price!

Good crisp picture, great audio.  The built in streaming (Raku) is fantastic!"
ordered my tv in stil not here there always a excuse o today then tomorrow now what still nothing if i could give a 0 i would
Excellent TV. We love it so much. Great picture and sound. Love the Roku streaming capabilities. Very happy with this purchase.
Everything went prefect wish there were more rca plugs because I have old equipment that don't have HDMI but works better than the new crap
Did not last 6 months a total waste of money. I should have bought a Vizio. I have 2 Vizio’s still working after 10 years.
"very disappointed in this TV. it's not my first Hisense, but in this case right after the time limit to return, a line comes up in the screen."
I absolutely love this TV. This is my second one I bought. So easy to use and the check out process is so easy.
"I received tv late one day only to find out screen was broken.  
I believe damage was done thru FedEx during shipping."
Loved the fact that the TV was delivered.  Easy install and great picture and features with Hisense.
"I've had this tv for over a year now and it still works great, the quality is very clear and it's overall a great purchase!"
great pictures.  easy instructions.  the only problem was the television was delivered to the wrong house
"Using as computer monitor 4K @60hz. After a few initial adjustments to brightness, contrast, etc. it has met high expectations."
"Really like this TV. Picture is sharp and clear. The price was below other tvs, which is why I decided to try it"
There is nothing that I delike about this TV . I had one for about 5 years and never had a problem with it.
it was great then suddenly the picture is shot  it was fine when I went to work and when I got home it was niy it's only been 8 months
Arrived cracked— driver shoved it in back of his Honda accord so that’s probably why! Walmart you need to do better!
Unfortunately we had to return it. It’s not 4K and not ultra hd like it says. The quality of imagen is very bad.
I was only able to use my tv for three days before the screen went completely black. I can hear sound but nothing on the screen.
"The tv was delivered earlier than promised (good), and was easy to set up. Great picture quality and ease of use. Unbeatable price."
This TV is horrible! It has a mind of its own. It rewinds and fast forward on its own. It also shuts off on its own. A waste of money!
This TV arrived with a cracked screen on the inside of the glass.   The other 2 TVs ordered and shipped together were great.
I absolutely love this TV.  It is very easy to use. I had a roku stick so switching to a roku tv was seamless.  I recommend this tv to everyone.
"Picture went out on my TV, it has not been a year as of yet, I was offered a part to fix tv, I don’t agree, I want a replacement tv"
"Great picture, big tv, no complaints. You can't speak into the remote but you can download the remote app in your phone and speak into that."
"My Hisense Smart Roku 58"" tv has great picture quality. Thank you Walmart for the great price and smooth,fast delivery!"
Ordered online. FedEx delivered a smashed television. In the past my online orders arrived in excellent condition.
"The tv works perfect, the only thing we would like to know is if we can get a new Roku Tv remote with voice control because the one that comes with the tv doesn’t have it . Would it work?"
The TV screen is cracked and broken from the delivery. I had to wait for the mount and someone to come and put up the TV for me do I just found out today. What do I do to return this?
"Love my Hisense 58” Smart TV it is the right size, it also believed before time with care, easy to set up, shows A clear picture. I’ll Recommend this TV to anyone who is interested in this beautiful TV."
I know it doesn't have true 120hz but for 280 for a 58 inch tv wow the picture a response is amazing. The price for a 120hz rate is over 600 so I'll take 60hz until they drop in price and my last hisense lasted over 5 years thank you walmart.
"After only 5 months of use, factory seal is still intact, my tv has malfunctioned and now has black lines going down the left side and the tv is glitching out, contacted the store and I’m hoping I can get a replacement"
Bought two years ago and still love it! Zero issues and the picture is still amazing. We are going to buy another for our front room. You will not be disappointed for the value to price you get.
"I’m not gonna lie I was kinda hesitant on purchasing because the price was too good to be true. But this tv is phenomenal. It’s loud, clear and does what it needs to do. For sure a good buy!!!"
Excellent TV I went from three remotes TV soundbar Roku to one remote that way I don't have to go looking for stuff it's all in one location great picture great price great service.
This tv is a really really really good tv good price its amazing shipping was perfect it has every thing you need I suggest if you want a good tv for a low price this is for you
"The TV arrived a week late and was DOA. (Smashed screen) Sent it back for replacement over a week ago, still hasn't arrived and no one seems to know where it is. Worst experience I've ever had with Walmart!!!"
"You must of sent me, the same TV, you sent to the last comments! Box ripped, Glass Screen broke, No remote, No cord, even the Fed Ex driver was embarrassed, when he  deliver it! I usually don't speak out like this, BUT!! this was plum ridiculous!"
"For the price, I am very satisfied with this product. Picture quality is on point. Sound is great. And I am particularly fond of all the streaming apps through ROKU I get to utilize. Great buy!"
"I'm photosensitive so can't handle 60 refresh rate.  This was one of two 120 refresh rate televisions listed, and it had great sound quality reviews while the other had negative ones, so I bought this one as a gift to my nieces.  They just loved it."
Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. So far so good. Picture is very high quality. Sounds great! Fits perfectly in my cabinet. Smart system and Roku is a big plus. I'll give it about a month and then maybe buy another one at this price!
You won't find a better quality tv for this price anywhere! Easy to set up.. great pic and sound... looks high end!  I think it's better then my Phillips and as good as Visio
"The TV is great and excellent Value on all levels., be aware the the shipping company will leave it outside your door without any notice or even knock on your door at all."
"Absolutely love. And to think I was skeptical of purchasing this brand. The picture and sound is sharp and clear. Easy, Direct setup and I love using my  remote from my phone. Lastly the shipping was exactly on time. (2 days)"
"Setup is a two person job, but  all went well. Love all of the roku features. product has good sound and a great picture quality. Great value for the price."
"Love this tv, great picture quality and it has hdr. Don’t know any other brand that sells an 4K hdr tv for that price. Also I agree with what most of the ppl are saying, have it shipped to the store cuz shipping companies love to throw packages."
"This will be a long review, so let me just start by saying, this is NOT my first flat screen TV. In fact, I've had more than I can count. LOL

That said, the TV itself is what you want and probably expect from a, let's be honest, budget TV. For what is currently at $268 for a 58 inch TV there's not much competition for the price. And getting a very well respected budget brand in the process is just a bonus. 

Ok, now the weird part from the heading of my review. So I don't know if it was dumb luck, accidental carelessness (though I always strive to avoid this) or inferior build quality. It's a budget TV and a lower end model at a super low price, so I'm more inclined to believe a combination of dumb luck and inferior build quality. Like I'm betting most won't have this issue. Probably might not even notice it unless your super observant like me. OCD at it's peak and weirdest, but it keeps me very aware of even the littlest things. So in detail as to what happened I was putting on the legs. I lay my TV's flat on my bed for this. To apply legs means it's simply easier and smarter to flip it upside down and screw on that way. Well, when lifting vertically (upside down) the lower section of the back frame shifted slightly from where it's connected to the front. Not enough to see electronics inside, a bit of pressure put it back into alignment. Still, when TV is setup now a non noticeable difference exists as the realignment was good, but not perfect. Extremely marginal and undetectable unless your looking for it and even then, not visible, but barely enough that you can feel it. I know this is off because it's only on the right side, not the left side. Again, weird and only for those wanting to be crazy technical.

But really, it's one of those little things you might get from a super budget TV.

If you don't get this, like most won't, you'll be amazed. Even with it, it's again undetectable unless your looking hard for it, so it's an acceptably minor issue, especially given the price."
Initially we loved this TV.   Purchased late October.   Today (4 month's later) we turned the TV on to find Vertical lines going thru half the screen.   Of course Walmart will not do anything past the initial 30 days and says we have to contact the Manufacturer.    Essentially I paid $300 for a TV to work only 3 months?
"Ruined my Christmas and My nephews. 2 TVs delivered to my hope in very poor condition. The first did not work returned it next day. Ordered another different model, The Fed Ex Dropped it on my porch and left immediately. The Box looked like the Walmart warehouse were bored and decided to take their forklifts and put it through the TV Box they had FedEX accept in this condition and deliver it to me. This was on December 22.  I had to argue and fight with several people in Walmarts Care Department. What a joke. There was only one man who listed and hopefully has resolved this nightmare. The TV was finally delivered on January 9th.  Have no idea if it works until my nephew picks it up and installs it at his place. Anyway if I wasnt 70 and partially disabled, I would probably try to unpack it myself just to make sure it works before giving it to him."
"Set up was a breeze. We logged into our Roku account and all are old Apps were there. Tons of new Apps already downloaded for the kids. Sign Language, Spanish, Math games. Not just a tv. The only thing we've noticed is that the sound in other rooms is much louder than the room the TV is set up in. Pretty sure it's wall acoustics though, not the TV. Overall, great value for what you get. Better refresh rate then some higher end models too."
Worked fine until last week and all of the sudden half the screen goes out for a mew minutes now darkness. Can see the small red light blinking as I try to power it on but this thing seems a goner. Too badI've been recommending these and have purchased 5 of them!
"With the click of a few buttons I was able to order from NY and deliver to my parents in FL.   It arrived on time, 3 days, and in great condition.  We weren't there to help them set it up but was told it was easy.   They say they feel like they are at the drive in and love it."
"The only problem I had was mounting the TV to my wall using my existing universal mount. The hole pattern did not match up at all with my old 50"" tv and the screws weren't the same size. This tv requires M6 bolts and the 4-hole pattern is low in position. I definitely recommend ordering the mount that comes with it.. Everything else is great, so far... Purchased 1 week ago"
"Can't say about long term reliability of this brand but after two weeks using I liked it, except for the color adjustment. Hisense's default color settings were off and it was not easy to recalibrate. The color is bad if you watch from any angle more than 20 degrees from the direct view. Also the TV remote is Roku design and does not have numeric keys. Since I use over-the-air antenna, it's cumbersome to jump channels."
"The TV is great and a good deal.  DO NOT buy the $79 installation from HelloTech.  They will inundate you with requests and information before the scheduled appointment, but then not show up for the installation because the tech canceled it with NO contact to me and without setting foot on the property.   Find a reputable and competent installer."
"I like the tv, but this tv is very hard for me to connect my 0hone to I've done all the steps to try and connect and I still haven't been able to do so. My other smart tv automatically connect. This Roku you have to use mirror screening and it still didn't work for me. Overall it's still a smart tv perform well so it's not bad and I caught it on sale. So it's still worth it"
""
"This is a terrific TV for the price; a 58"" 4K below 300 bucks.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but this TV proved to be terrific.  The picture is crisp and clear.  The colors are great and the shadows are too.  It is easy to set up and easy to customize the picture as you like it."
"I purchased this on august 28th 2021. It is currently October 19th 2021 (less than 60 days after purchase) and this tv is awful. It stops functioning after only an hour of use. The remote doesn’t even communicate with the tv most of the time. All the remote actions (when it does connect) are extremely delayed. The apps take ages to launch and we have gigabit internet here, so we know the internet isn’t a problem. All other tvs, laptops, tablets, phones are connected and running extremely speedy on the same network. All of my complainants stem from the fact that this tv is not a good purchase and wouldn’t recommend even at this price. 

The worst part is that my phone app says I can return until November but when I click return it won’t let me!!! Walmart, please let me return this as it is still (according to your website) in the eligible window of return."
"Very disappointed in picture quality. Not crisp nor clear no matter how I adjust the picture settings.  Sound also fuzzy and mono quality. Nothing close to Dolby sound as advertised.  Going to return it and buy the TCL 55"" TV, which I had previously. The TCL had an excellent sharp image and nearly theater stereo sound."
"We purchased this TV sight unseen.  We had done some shopping at other stores but everything was a lot more money than we wanted to spend. We took a chance on this Hisense 58"" TV for $378. Ordered on Thurs and it arrived on Monday...very fast shipping right to the door. Was well packed and no damaged box or TV.  It is a lot larger than we expected but man, do we like it. We had a Hisense previously but without Roku and it was great. This one did not disappoint.  The speakers are very good and we get a crisp, clear and sharp picture.  Now everyone comes to watch football at our house."
I've now had 4 Hisense televisions.  I had an issue with the first one and Hisense sent someone out to fix it quickly. I've had no problems since.  The brand is quality and affordable and I don't hesitate to recommend it for someone looking for a great TV at a great price.
"Not a great picture. Half the channels have the audio and video out of sync, especially after coming back to the show from a commercial.  I wish I would have gone with a higher end smart tv and just attached a external Roku device. This might be a good tv for a kid that needs a screen for gaming."
"This is a great price for the size and features. The Roku interface is so user friendly. The picture looks great whether you're streaming, watching a blu-ray/4k disc, or gaming. It's not much more than much smaller TVs. I am very pleased with my purchase."
"For the price its decent. It's start you off by programing your apps. Great picture quality on standard; in HDMI it has different options to adjust screen. Takes two people to move onto shelf or bracket, One if you were tough like me. Be careful, it says not to put to much pressure on screen by lifting."
"So far, so good. Built in WiFi works well. My Router is about 30' feet away and in another room but I get an EXCELLENT signal at 5GHz.

For those wanting to know the distance between the feet, it's just a tad less than 41.5"", which allows it to sit on my cabinet that is 41.5""."
"Most TVs have an Audio Output (Headphone) 3.5mm port.. They’re usually used as an Audio Out to connect to an external amp or soundbar..  The 3.5mm socket one on this TV is strictly Only for headphones.. When you plug something into it, the TV’s speakers are disabled. And the power coming from it isn’t enough to pump sound into an amp or soundbar.. For an external amp or soundbar, you Must use the TV’s Optical (SPDIF/Toslink) digital output! If you’re sound equipment doesn’t have an optical (Toslink) input, you’ll need to buy an Optical Digital to RCA (Analog) converter. That’s what I had to do (for $13 more dollars..)
Other than that, the TV looks and works great!"
"My husband was smacking a spider, that was dangling down from the ceiling, with his hat, and his hat come out of his hand and hit our 50” Inch TV. SO, we bought this one, and we have had it about a year, I think! No issues. Great Price and large TV. Could not complain."
"I'm very impressed with this Hisense TV. It includes Roku built in and the Picture quality is pretty good as long as you make some necessary tweaking and calibration. The sound is decent and clear enough but i would still add a soundbar or home theater. 

As for the cons, There's some minor LED backlight bleeding around the edges, not a huge deal breaker but it's annoying enough if you zone into it. The Menu could use some work with some more added settings to tweak. Also the bad thing about Roku remotes is they're small and you can't type in over the air channels because there's no number dial. I'm sure with a universal remote this can be remedy but overall this TV is a solid buy for the price."
"Great 4K TV for the price. The only thing that I would like to the TV to be able to do is turn the screen off but leave the sound on. I keep Music Choice playing in the background from my cable box for the music/sound, but I do not need to see the screen. My previous LG TV allowed me to turn the screen off while still keeping the sound on. Hopefully Hisense Roku will update the software."
Price to performance and value can not be beat. Obviously if i were to connect test equipment to this TV it would show issues and faults with the image. You cant compare this TV with $2000 plus TVs. I replaced this TV with a 14 year old what was at the time the top model TV from a Japanese company. This picture is so much more pleasing to view and i paid 1/10 the price. My only issue is Hisense does not have the greatest website. But i didnt buy a website.
"So far so good with this tv. I purchased this brand Hisense because my brother in Chicago has one and he told me about it years ago, but I just recently brought it. I am extremely apprehensive when it comes to purchase electronics, but so far I am in love with my big tv. I watch it all day and I feel like I am sitting in a theater because it is so big. The only thing is if I go into my Youtube thru Roku instead of the tv cable its not that loud and that's on 100 the highest of the volume."
"I have yet to open the tv up. But the young couple who delivered it was so kind and helped me get the tv into my entryway to my house. I wished I could figure out how to tip them, this is a whole new world too me. If anyone could tell me how to do that I would be so very thankful for the help."
"Got this in May for hubby's birthday. He.... well we, as in the entire family, absolutely love it! picture is great, menus are easy to use. We were pleasantly surprised with the sound quality...sounds great. We have no external speakers attached, don't need to! Loving this purchase so far!"
"I was looking to upgrade screen size from my then current 50"" 4K tv. Stopped by Walmart to check out 65"" models. Saw this on clearance display for less than $300. Ok, so it's not a 65"" screen but, it's 4K with Roku built in. To me, it was a no-brainer. When I set it up, it was appreciably larger than the set it replaced. Set up, connecting to my wifi, downloading the Roku channels I wanted, all was stupid easy! The picture is very good. I have mine connected to a sound bar / subwoofer setup, but the sound through this sets' built in speakers was much better than what I've experienced with other flat screen TV'S. So far, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"This is really an outstanding TV at an excellent price.  The biggest difference between the far more expensive units and this one is how it is preset.  This is where patience comes in, but it is worth the time.  Setting up the TV was easy and there are two different places you can put the legs, inner and outer, depending on the size of the surface you're placing the TV on.  Now, I'm always looking for that image you get in the stores to show up on my TV, and it can be done.  I suggest once you're set up going to YouTube on the TV and choosing a 4k video to have on while you set your picture the way you want it.  I spent a good 90 minutes working with the settings to find just that ""perfect"" set of settings to bring out the best this TV has to offer in the space I am using it in.  It's worth the investment of your time.  I'm also a bit of an audiophile so I chose to use a sound bar.  In the TV settings, not cable or other settings, but on the Roku screen, the options under settings allow you to turn off the built-in sound and that will automatically turn the sound to the toslink, or digital audio port, so you can use a sound bar or other system of your choice.  It's an excellent TV worth the time and investment.  Take your time on day 1 and you'll enjoy id for years to come."
So far so good with a single exception - the remote.  On one hand the remote is very simple and very basic which I like.  On the other hand it has no number pad so switching between stations is a somewhat tedious process.  I did download the Roku App which allows me to use my phone as a remote which also allows for using my voice to chage stations which is nice but the remote that came with should either be voice enabled or have a number pad
Purchased 2 of these as I had already been a Hisense owner in the past. Hisense has proven to be a great tv and has NEVER given me any problems.  The only problem I had was one of my 65 inch roku tvs was damaged by heat during either shipment or in the warehouse.  Walmart immediately refunded me and had me to keep the damaged tv in which worked fine once hooked up to cable. they had the photos and made the decision to refund themselves.  This 58 inch is awesome as well as any I have owned. the price dont do it justice.  Well done!!
"The Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV so far is GREAT. I have only had it a little over a week now. But the picture is really good, the sound is clear and gets pretty loud. The Roku is easy to figure out, I have no experience with a Roku but no problem there. And it big 58 inches is really big. After more I will update my review if needed, if nothing changes then no update."
"I was nervous about buying this after reading the reviews but I am glad I did. Great picture, easy set up. This is my third Hisense tv. I had the first one go out but they got it fixed right away for me, no charge due to warranty, and it is still working 8 years later. Standing by that warranty gave me some confidence to get this tv. I love the roku platform ànd not paying for cable."
"I liked this television so much I bought a second one.  It is full of tricks that you have to explore to discover.  For example, it defaults to starting with a display that shows all the streaming channels, but if you mostly use just one channel (e.g. DVR) then you can default it to always start with that channel and exit up to the streaming channels on a click of the button.  I especially like the way you can cast youtube from your tablet in a single click and the TV will turn itself on and display the video.  It also has a USB port to show a slideshow of your pictures and videos.  I just wish it would natively work with bluetooth headphones."
"Don't trust this tv. It died two days ago, conveniently a few days out of warranty. It did great while it played, good price too, so I guess we should just consider it to be a ""throwaway"" type. No real complains on the tv itself, just expected longer service"
"Opened the box and the screen looked like the TV might be ""on"". When beginning to take TV out of the box saw the entire screen was broken,dented and had cracked lines covering the screen. No wonder this 58 inch was so cheap. Have to deal with the hassle of returning it to Walmart."
Purchased this for my son in October of 2021 for his new apartment today he calls to tell me that there is only a black screen when the system is on.   Said he worked for several hours to get it to work but you can only hear the program but their is no picture just black screen!   I would expect a TV to last longer the. 90 days!   Tried contacting the local Walmart to see if we can return.   I am hoping Walmart stands by their products.
"I gave this smart T.V. a 4 star only because I was having remote issues where it was hard to turn volume up or down (not sure y) The best thing about it is that apps like Hulu, Netflix, Tubi, etc were built in T.V. so therefore I didnt needed firesticks anymore!!"
"Purchased this TV after an issue with a new Samsung purchased the day before. I was skeptical, but it was cheaper and larger. Reviews weren't all bad so figured why not. I did have to set up a Roku account but that was fine. FYI...you can skip putting in your credit card. Set up was easy and so far there have been no problems. Don't need a sound bar"
"Set-up was fast and simple.  Great picture and sound for the price.  Rivals a more expensive class of TVs.  Seems to be of good quality manufacturing.  Easily added a Sound  Bar for even better sound.  Yes the set has an eArc port, and a couple of other HDMIs.  Just read the screen to program your personal settings.  Easy to establish and organize Streaming channels.  

I have activated Xfinity Stream Beta, no longer a need for a cable box.  Buy a Roku Voice Remote, its well worth it, and one button to activate and program.   Can't help but recommend this Smart TV."
"I purchased this tv as an upgrade from a 47"" vizio, and it was just that. An upgrade. Superior sound from what sounds like a built in sound bar. Picture quality is clear and vibrant. Smart tv functions are quick and repsonive to remote buttons. Set up was a breeze and all for under $400.  I would highly recommend this tv."
Tv is great for the price! We just set it up yesterday. We love the RoKU aspect. We noticed the volume changes depending on what you are watching which needs to be adjusted after. It may just be a setting to figure out. Overall great purchase. What a great deal!
"We just got this tv and I love it. We dont really use Roku because we have Directv, but I love how easy it is to access Netflix etc!!  We thought there was a sound problem and thought we tried every setting there was; but when we finally looked at the Directv audio settings (not the tv audio) and changed to Dolby the sound was perfect!!"
"Purchased February 7, 2021 and it is now June 27, 2023 and it no longer works. I feel like it should've lasted more then 1 1/2 years. So disappointed. Tried all the resets and nothing but a dark screen. It powers up and nothing else. I know I could've purchased an extended warranty, but I have a Vizio that was purchased almost 10 years ago and it is still doing amazing. Truly loved the tv and want to buy another, however I am not willing to have to buy a new tv every 1 1/2 years."
This was a great purchase. The picture is clear and crisp. We love the ease of the Roku operating system. The option to plug an ethernet cord into the tv as an alternative to WiFi to connect to the internet is nice. I am very satisfied with this purchase. I would definitely buy again tomorrow if I needed to.
"I purchased the Hisense Roku smart 4k tv almost 2 year's ago.. worst tv ever.. going to finally break down and buy a new one to replace this piece of manure.. I pay for 100  mbps on my wifi to enjoy the so-called ""4k.. that would be great if Roku and/or this crappy Hisense manufacturer would NOT CAP MY SPEEDS BY 50%!. seriously I have spent countless hour's and energy and money trying to get this and other glitches fixed.. both sides point at each other.. come to find out that because the firmware updates cause issue's.. I'm only allowed 50% of WHATEVER SPEED I AM CAPABLE.. example at 40mbps they pnly allow me 20mbps.. if its 50mbps its 25mbps.. no matter what speed my wifi is.. the tv only allows my streaming to run a 50% of whatever my speed is at.. NOT ONLY IS THIS THE ISSUE.. but the tv freezes constantly.. shuts off.. the restarts on its own at all hours day and night.. can't even get through a whole movie without this happening.. the volume adjustment intermittently lags horribly.. ull hit the but.. nothing.. u hit it a couple more times.. nothing.. then all of a sudden ur volume shoots to the highest or lowest setting at once.. seriously STAY AWAY FROM THE TV MANUFACTURER AND ANYTHING ROKU.. BOTH ARE SOME SHADY THEIVES.. I HAVE GOOGLE TV ON MY OTHER TV AND NEVER HAVE ISSUES IN OVER 7-8 YEAR'S NOW!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND.. AND ROKU!!"
"Doesn’t give the picture I thought it would, has to be adjusted at times, tv is not loud at all, but my kids don’t mind that. I just hope it lasts the so many hours it says it will. Otherwise, it’s big and nice. Wish I would’ve known though, maybe this is what a 4K is about. Not sure"
"Such as sound is in TV sets these days, it's pretty good. But the picture is amazing. The color and clarity rivals that of far more expensive TVs I have in my house. The modest price of this set should not deter anyone from the purchase of it. I bought the same one for my in-laws previously and they are as pleased with it as I am. Great deal and a bargain even if it cost a hundred bucks more than I paid for it..."
"This TV is an excellent tv for the price. It has an excellent clear picture. I do like and notice the extra 3"" over a typical 55"" I like the fact that you can set up the tv so when you use your cable remote to turn on tv it automatically turns on the tv and cable box. You don't have to select the cable box up. It also has 2 sets of stands in case the outer stands are too far out that the tv will not fit on the stand. Sound is excellent. We took the 4 year extended warranty as I saw too many reviews where the tv went out after too short a time. Very satisficed."
"I was hesitant at first but turns out it’s a good TV and it’s budget friendly . It has a lot of built in features which are easy to navigate through , screen and audio quality is on par with other popular brands. The OS and connectivity response time is faster than I expected, highly recommend to purchase in store in order to avoid piety shipping damages."
"Purchased Jan 2022. TV worked for exactly 15 months. Contacted Walmart, as expected, nothing they could/would do. Contacted Hisense, same results. I let Hisense know that I would never purchase a Hisense product ever again. Replaced TV with a Samsung."
IIm having trouble getting access to the audio controls of the TV itself in order to direct the sound tomorrow receiver with its customized speaker system. There is a little documentation of how to do this. And no documentation on how to pair up even the Roku remote with the TV
"I purchased this TV right after Black Friday, it was still on sale. It has been great so far. The remote is small though. I’ve misplaced it a few times. Just download the Roku app and connect it to your tv- it doubles as a remote and takes less than 5 minutes to download and connect."
"So far so good, it came in very good condition. I read bad reviews mostly of packaging and people getting it broken, I'm so glad mine came perfect. I mounted it and it's working flawlessly. Bought it with 3 year protection and I'm hoping to never need it."
"I was not familiar with a Roku TV until I got this one and I feel like I have been missing out! I am blown away at all the free programming available!! I am satisfied with the sound, size and picture and feel like I got my moneys worth with this television. I can appreciate the simple remote as well! I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this TV to family and friends."
"First off, I have only had this tv for under a week, so far though it's an amazing set! Awesome picture and easy setup. Now, it showed two remotes on the outside of the box but only came with it, it's a very small basic function remote. No matter, my cable remote runs it all fine and I'm sure a universal remote will work fine too. While the sound is nothing to brag on, it's what I have come to expect from tv's these days, as none of them seem to have good sound. I will be getting a sound bar soon so that will take care of that. The tv itself is just what was described and is no disappointment at all! So, all that being said, for the price, I do not belive you can find a better set of this size anywhere, and I did look thoroughly prior to buying this one!"
"The picture is very clear and bright. The software leaves a lot to be desired. I have to restart the TV once or twice a week. Once I had to do a factory reset to fix the software. The pause feature stops working for reasons I don't understand, then just starts working again. I have to disconnect and reconnect the soundbar from the HDMI outlet once a week because the sound shuts off."
I bought this television for my bedroom I got the 4-year warranty had it for about a year it's a nice television for the price so just take a chance and just make sure you get the warranty.. I'm sure it's not the best on the market but it has a nice bright picture colors are nices and HDR10  4k  $300
"I bought this t.v about 7 mnths ago and its been terrible 😡 it started going blank, or shutting off on its own. I would have to disconnect from the wall outlet and re-plug for it to turn back on.  Or it would take so long to restart absolutely horrible t.v brand!!  I got the warranty and yet im still here trying either to get a refund or another t.v that actually works 🤬 frustrating but honestly, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS T.V BRAND .. beware !!!"
Everything About It.
"I got my new tv about a week ago(01-02-2021) and it's very nice especially for the price. The picture quality is absolutely stunning and crisp even in 1080p. Haven't seen anything in 4k yet but I can only imagine. The bezel is slim too. The sound is pretty good for a tv. Also, if you're a gamer like me, you will love it even more."
"mine had no damage, so ignore those reviews. sometimes things happen when shipped. anyway. if you can drive it with the right devices and get to Atmos and dolby vision / hdr it's extremely vivid and a very solid tv. I'm running a fire stick 4k and roku ultra 2020.  personally the roku 2020 wakes this thing up. the only negative feedback I can give is the edge can tend to be lit moreso than the rest of the screen, being full array I figured that wouldn't be a thing. under dolby vision this is actually mostly missing."
They sold me a crack tv
love it but it said it had voice remote which was one of the selling points for me but nope it has a sleep button instead. very upset about that I don't want to use my phone or the app on it. it was supposed to be on the remote. or I would have given it a 5
"This tv is amazing for the price I paid. Its huge, easy to set up and has the most gorgeous picture. Super crisp. I had to add a sound bar because I was afraid of blowing the speakers. No, Im not deaf, its because my ac is a little on the loud side. Go buy it. You'll thank me."
"The tv is ok. The sound goes in and out a bit and theres a 2 inch border around the screen that’s lighter than the middle of the tv. For only $300 I can live with that. On the other hand, the remote is POORLY designed. Why?! There’s no numbers on it! To change the channel you have to scroll through 500 channels. Sometimes the channel will randomly change and It takes 4 entire minutes to get back to the show you were watching and by that time you missed a huge plot point! Why is the remote so bad?!!! There’s an app, but it doesn’t let you go to channels if you use an antennae. It’s insanity!"
Box off the Fed Ex truck had a good dent on the corner but the TV was in perfect shape . For the money (338 bucks ) this set was well worth it . Easy setup although you are pretty much forced to set up Roku . No charge so it wasn't bad . I dont have a 4K disc player but blurays on my PS4 look fantastic . 2 weeks in I am loving this TV
"Overall this is a great TV for the price.  I dislike the size of the remote it is small, functional, but very small.  The remote cannot be used to channel select via the number and channels must be selected in the guide.  The audio is really good and picture quality is fine.  I have only had this television for a couple of weeks so I won't comment on the durability or other performance.  I would but this television again."
I have no issues with the product.  However carrier who delivered my tv left it outside my apartment door. Did not check to see if anyone was home. Knocked on door and left. That could have easily been a free TV for someone else. Very poor delivery service.
"Saw some reviews mentioning dimmer parts of the screen. That is common with cheaper TVs and expected it on this. However, i didnt experience that at all with mine.

Contrast and colors look great. Speaker is above average for the price. Motion handling is not the best but expected. Very little complaints for the price. solid buy if you want to save some money"
"I have 4 Hisense TV’s, two 40 inch, one 50 inch and now this 58 inch. In all I paid $900 for all four and have not had a single issue with any of them over the past 4 years. Hisense is a fantastic budget brand that does not cut corners on quality.

As for this specific TV, it is beautiful. Picture is great, set up is easy! One remote controls everything and Roku is built in. You can get your local channels crystal clear with a cheap antenna on amazon with the built in tuner, no need for cable. 

If you are a gamer this TV has HDR which makes the games look and play amazing! 

At $278 this is a no brainer. Are there better 58” TV’s out there, yes, but not for under $300 after tax shipped.

Don’t even think about it, get this TV, you won’t be disappointed!"
"I enjoy the picture and the convenience of a smart tv after owning for less than 3 months it is randomly shutting itself off.  No rhyme or reason just suddenly pops up ""thinking"" and powers off.  Going to check into returning it as it is happening more frequently and is very annoying"
"this is a terrible tv. 3 months after buying this with the 3 year protection plan and i get a black screen when opening netflix, hulu, etc. contact warranty and am told to contact manufacturer due to it being less than a year old. within 24 hours it randomly starts working so they tell me to do a firmware update and thats it. now it has been 8 months after the original issue and my tv turns on but its a black screen. you can hear everything in touching on the remote and the red led light blinks when i touch the controles. same issue, still under manufacturer warranty but at this point i dont even want this tv brand anymore with these issues ive had in less than a year. itll also randomly shut off but lets me turn it on right away. such a waste of money and the protection plan has done nothing for me."
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this tv! The resolution is very good and I really like the setup of the home area on the smart tv. The remote is easy to use and the access to apps on it is very convenient. It is very easy to connect the tv with a soundbar as well for better quality.
"So far, I like everything about this TV. Picture and sound are wonderful. The setup is easy, just takes a little time. Be sure to use a high end HDMI Cable ( HDMI Certified) for the best sound. The timer is a nifty feature. Its relatively easy to navigate."
"A friend recommended this model after our older TV died. I was very leery of the name since I had never heard of it. It has NOT disappointed. For roughly $300 for a 55 inch,  i have a great Roku TV that rivals my son's more expensive Samsung. The picture is clear, the colors are spot on, and the audio is great. We originally set this up with a satellite provider, but have since gone with cable. The only difference is each company's layout. I only wanted to use one remote (rather than one for TV and one for Cable) so I did have to call the 1-800 number to get the right code to set up the remote. The codes in the manual did not include an updated one. I ordered this online, it was delivered to my door, and my husband and I had it up and working in no time.  When my other TV goes out, I will be replacing it with a Hisense."
"Love it. 
We wirelessly stream our TV (Hulu, Netflix, Discovery Plus, Amazon Prime Video etc.) ... 
We had moved from another state and when we arrived we sent our Son to pick up a smaller Hisense ROKU TV for temporary use in the Living Room until we got a larger one, he picked up some other ""Smart TV"" ... Visio I think it is, it was horrible, worst TV ever!!  We had to reboot the TV 6  times per day and was pretty sure it wasn't our internet since we have the fastest fiber internet offered.
Since receiving this Hisense, we don't have to reboot the TV half a dozen times a day, browsing through different menus for streaming services, the TV doesn't freeze constantly like that other brand.
Since we worked contract for the last 15 years, we moved every 2 or 3 years and would sell out and start over, after getting our first Hisense TV, it was great and we've gotten them every time we moved.
This is our final Retirement home and this 58"" might later be moved from the Living Room to the Master Bedroom when the remodel is finished, and we're going to get another Hisense TV (maybe around 65"") for the living room and a few 40"" or 42"" Hisense TVs for the guest bedrooms.
Highly recommend any Hisense TV ... we have had nothing but fantastic luck since our first one."
"Awesome! Price was incredible(three hundred total), plus a Roku added in. Bexel is thin, but the screen technically starts a little more in. So double the bezel on the top and sides. It is still thinner than the bottom Bezel. I would buy this again in a heartbeat!"
I had this TV for 30 days and it soon developed a scrambled bar on top of the screen the day before the return window expired. Initially it was a decent picture however I soon noticed a halo around the screen edges during certain scenes which became annoying. The best thing about this TV is the fast responsiveness it has with the remote.
"It's huge!! I don't think I realized quite how big this tv is until I got it in my living room. It's a roku tv, so it's really minimized the number of remotes. It works with the Roku app too, so I don't even really need a remote!! The picture is awesome. I have a sound bar. I don't think the tv sounds good, but I'm really picky about audio, so I expected that it was going to be low quality. My son doesn't mind the way it sounds. It gets loud. Initially, I'm impressed. I think it was an awesome value, and I bought the warranty just in case. I did see the smaller version of this TV at Costco for about $45 more than I paid for this tv and warranty, so I feel pretty good about this deal."
"Some sound quality features issues compared to the 4 series TCL , Witch took a dump so i bought this and really like it ..... the full back lit dobly picture is better than the HDR ON TCL EDGE LIT ... TRUST ME i had two and still have the 65 inch tcl ..good tv too"
"Was just eye buying to compare different televisions with ROKU. Seen this as we were leaving the electronic section and were blown away when we seen the cost. There were smaller TVs which cost more, we couldn't resist! Love the picture! Love the size. But really love that we don't have to order another cable box in order to enjoy our cable service."
"Easy to set up; does require a credit card but no issue if nothing is purchased.  Not the best nor the worst.  Works for my purpose which is a larger tv in my den (upgrade from 42"") and I thought it was a good deal.  My 32"" Hisense in the bedroom has worked well and I had/have no reservations purchasing this one.  Just wish I had done a bit more research and gotten one with a voice remote but, for me, it works well and I'm not sure it is available on the 58"".  Would purchase Hisense again."
Great value for the money. I was never a fan of spending over $1500 for the latest and largest TV when I can buy a smaller size for 8x less money. The included Roku is very useful and even though this is not a big name brand it has worked perfectly for me so far.
"After much research, I found this budget (priced) Roku television at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  The price was more than reasonable for the specs being offered.  It was delivered without incident and the box was in perfect condition.  The item was well packed and easy to put together (only requires attachment of the legs).  Upon powering it up, I discovered it was very easy to set up"
This is an awesome TV for the money. I researched Hisencse and it was very comparable to Sony and Samsung. The back light has great contrast to the TV. There’s lots of free shows and movies that can be put on it’s a good TV for the money I bought the 58 inch and had a 55 inch previously. It was super easy to install you just need to HDMI cords if you want to put a sound bar on.
"Failed at 80 days after purchase.   Stone cold dead, researching on google it appears power supply is a problem.    Had the extended warranty but it doesn't kick  in until after first year (supposedly manufacturing is responsible for first year of warranty), just sent  hisense a request.   Will update post with results.  At this point very disappointed"
Had this TV for little over a week I was looking for a ROKU TV first tv  ( not a Hisense)  sent back picture was not clear and crisp line this one. The TV has a great picture and bright. I like the Roku included too. Glad I got this TV hopefully I feel like this in 2 years !
"Absolutely loved this tv , it's picture quality and sound but unfortunately this tv's longevity is only 4 years. Was watching tv one night and the next morning it would turn on just a blinking red light. Did all of the “reset” actions and nothing helped called The company and basically told me since it not under warranty, it's nothing they could do but referral me somewhere to get the tv fixed smh.  
So yeah buy only if you don't mind replacing in a couple years."
"This was a new brand for me but the price was too good to pass up. I brought this one on sale and I was surprised at how easy it was to manage myself, it's suprising light for its size, and simple to set up. I  would recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade. Don't be afraid of the new brand this is a quality product. I would buy this TV again."
"Ordered the TV on a Wednesday and was promised two day delivery.  Fedex finally showed up with the TV on Sunday.  Anyway, setup was straight forward.  I already had a Roku account, so all my channels showed up ready to go.  The picture is great.  Hopefully,  I will get years of service out of the TV."
"This is our second Hisense purchased.  The other was a 50 inch purchased a number of years ago.  Worked fine till recently so we purchased a Hisense 58 inch from Walmart at a decent price.  Two reasons for only a 4 star rating---picture on the 58"" model not as crisp"
"This hisense 58 inch tv is amazing! As a customer who purchased it and set it up, I feel there are a few things you should know while you are setting up this particular TV. After you plug it in and turn it on it will take you to a process of setting up an account with Roku and it will ask you to download the Roku app on your mobile phone. Durango's process it will look like it's stuck on a set up screen with your email address on it, but it is actually downloading updates and free content channels and apps. The cycle takes about 30 minutes so do not panic it is not broken. Install the app on your phone when I told you to and run the app and then just put it down let your phone and the TV do its thing there's not much to look at there are no special screens or anything it just takes 30 minutes but I promise you it is not stuck. After this time it recycles and you are ready to watch your new TV.  It is amazing are use it with my xfinity cable service which includes Wi-Fi. It also lets me stream and mirror my phone to my TV through Apple airplay which is amazing. It also works with hey Google and I believe it may work with Alexa as well. It has plenty of HDMI outlets for your Blu-ray player video games you can hook up your laptops to it and use it as a monitor, we absolutely love it the color and picture is amazing. Just be sure when you adjust your picture settings that you don't leave the back light on to high that will preserve the life of your TV . Recommend it"
"This is the best TV I have ever owned.  It puts the competition on notice.  Super high quality, incredible 4k upscaling picture, THS theater surround sound, and voice command  So easy to setup, and totally user friendly.  Fantastic bang for the buck.  Simply cannot be beat.  True value, and quality features make for a real winner!!!!  I love it!"
"Our 55"" decided to bite the dust after only 15 months.  Called my son to ask how he liked his Hisense 55"" and he told me that it was perfect.  For the price I took a chance on the Hisense 58"" figuring that if it wasn't up to snuff it could always serve as a backup.  My wife"
"DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!! STAY AWAY FROM  Hisense , so call crystal clear Roku Smart TV  YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM!!! Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this hunk a  junk. didn't even have it 5 months. Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku started overheating, Volume went out and shuts off. Afterwards. Unplugging it for a while, the volume comes bask on, but over heating once again. Over the the years I have purchased many tvs in the past, that last for years, but the 55 inch Hisense model 58R6E3 tv is the first tv I have ever purchased that did'nt last as long as a snowball in July.  $398.00 wasted. My next step is to contact the Hisense manufacture to find out how much it will cost to fix it, if too expensive, I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a 55 inch Samsung Smart tv for my front room because I Have one in the back room and It has worked well for the past 5 yrs with no problems at all. I would not recommend the Hisense 58"" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV to my worse enemy.  BUYER BEWARE!!!  Garbage TV!!!!"
for the price and not being Black Friday $300 out the door for HDR 10 plus Adobe vision 58-in TV with Roku is a great deal TV looks good Roku works good looks amazing it could be a little brighter but still an amazing valley in my opinion I love playing video games on it PS4 looks amazing my Plex looks great just all around great value
"I'm stuck with using two remotes, one to change channels and one for volume/mute control.  That's the main thing I don't like about this TV and why I do not recommend it.  I'm on Direct TV with Genie remotes.  The remote programmed just fine, but when I could not affect the volume with the Genie, I called Hisense customer service.  The lady on the other end very cheerfully told me it would not be possible to use only one remote, that's just the way it is.  She was not as cheerful when I asked her to send a message up the chain of command that I would be returning the TV for that reason - nobody wants to use two remotes.  If you don't have cable or satellite and only intend to stream, then this is probably fine for you."
Tv isn’t even a year old and picture just stopped working. Won’t do anything. When it was working it had great picture and worked well. Bought the 2 year plan from Walmart. Called to get tv replaced and Walmart won’t do anything. Come to find out the tv has a one year warranty with the manufacturer. So they’re sending someone out to fix or replace it. Waste of money on the Walmart warranty.
"I cant say I keep up with the lightning evolution of TV's and all their features, so Im sure some are looking for a specific picture quality. In my case, I needed an inexpensive ROKU TV that worked with Spectrum streaming, since my Sony TV's dont have a Spectrum contract. With a little research I found out that Hisense is the number one selling brand in Korea.  58"" LED with 4K, UHD smart TV with ROKU at $375!? This TV as intended to finish off my outside sports Man Cave, but it was so good for the money, I kept it in my living room and intend to buy another one for the Man Cave.  I love the isolated vocals setting function in that I can finally hear dialog on movies when action noise otherwise drowns it out so Im not constantly raising then lowering the volume.  The picture is great to me and frankly it kind of takes it back to that sweeping cinemetorgraphy feel instead of weird semi 3D motion feel of most HD TV's. Its hard to imagine anther TV of this size better for the money"
"There are better sets out there, but this is a VERY good TV set for the money.  Streaming UHD (4K) video clips from YouTube looks fabulous!  Excellent 4K picture.  Going through the initial setup menus was a breeze.  Love the bezel-less design.  Love that you can choose a smaller width foot stand, as opposed to the normal wide stand; when you can't hang the set on the wall.  Love the fundamental functionality of a television set built around Roku.  Love the dedicated headphone jack in the back.  TV set is light for its size.
     The only annoying thing is considerable off-gassing fumes coming from the TV.  The fumes are the normal new TV smell.  But with this set, they are stronger than for any other new set I've had.  Now, after having it plugged in and in use for a couple of weeks, the fumes have abated about half of what it was.  At this rate, I expect to barely notice the fumes after having it for a month.  This strong off-gassing new TV smell is the only thing preventing a 5 star review."
"I bought this tv based off the good reviews but my personal experience was horrible. The first 58’ I purchased was glitching, the screen would constantly black out. I took it back for a exchange and the second one had a message pop up that wouldn’t go away that said the usb device requires more power, nothing was connected into the USB port. I called customer service and after nothing worked that they had me to try I was told to just return the TV because it was defective and that a lot of people have been calling about the same issue. The issues with both tv’s started 1-2 days after I bought them."
"My TV is great. The perfect size I wanted and brand. But the delivery was horrible. I got an email saying it was outside about 9am and went to check my porch, there was nothing there. Im thinking somebody stole it. Meanwhile, they just didnt deliver it until about 1pm. The delivery person did not knock on the door and I was sitting right in my living room."
"Was excited for a new TV until the unboxing came. Only 1 leg was a killer and Hisense customer service has likewise been poor. I was asked to send a receipt which was no problem...until I got the email bounce back that their mailbox was full. Not quite confidence inspiring that I will have a standing TV any time soon. Over 30 minutes each time on hold so far, so considering boxing it back up and taking it back to WalMart. If service is this bad before I plug it up, I'd hate to see how it is after something serious goes wrong. 
Gave them one star because it came in a box and another because the cord was attached."
Great tv for a affordable price. Was extremely easy to set up and has a good picture and sound quality. I was not looking for anything fancy just wanted to upgrade my living room TV. It actually was bigger than I expected and have not had any issues at all.  I bought it in store so I did not have to worry about any damage from having it delivered.
"I bought this tv for my son's room for his games.  Yes its a bit big and takes up entire dresser but o'well! Its easy to set up looks great and equipped with the Roku already to watch Netflix,  Prime, etc. I suggest getting the protection insurance just in case and at this price why not? You won't be disappointed!"
"This TV looks amazing, but I think it came with a bad HDMI/ARC output.  I also bought a Hisense sound bar but the output is so low on the ARC output you have to turn the volume up to the 90's to get close to the original TV speakers.  I'm disappointed because, yes, I can use the optical output, but this TV is set up for my in-laws and you have to use the sound bar remote change the volume.  Not so easy for older folks."
This television’s picture looks just as good as our Samsung tv. I would highly recommend this one. I’ve waited a few months before posting my review so that I could give you accurate information. Don’t pass this one by just because it doesn’t have the “big brand” name.
"Simply put, if you subscribe to high-speed Internet, and you're interested in pay television as well, then streaming makes the most sense. You might as well use your Internet subscription to access the TV services that appeal to you. 

The Hisense Roku is the best TV I've ever owned. The Roku interface is famously simple and clutter-free. It's easy to find apps that will serve as cable replacements, and there are video-on-demand services for just about everyone. 

The TV itself includes an antenna input, three HDMI ports for connection to other devices, a USB port for flash drives, and an ethernet port for direct wiring to your modem. Notably, the Hisense model also includes the red, white, and yellow RCA inputs for connection to older devices that may not support HDMI cables."
"This TV is awesome for the money, a true value. I came from a 1080p plasma with an Nvidia shield as my smart device and this tv gives my Nvidia octa-core Processor a run for its money. All the apps load fast and roku has a ton of them, even one I turn on for my dogs when I go to work.  Coming from my old plasma tv, its an eye opening picture change. The picture truly goes all the way to the edge and the sound quality is decent.  Roku also has an app for your phone to use as the remote control which is pretty cool when you dont want to go fishing in your couch for the remote that came with the TV.  The only Weakness I can even point out on this TV, is that the picture gets a little bit lighter at the edge or looses the crispness of the black contrast, but that is such a small distraction and is easily forgotten about or overlooked.  If I had a bigger house, I would buy one for every room.  Great buy for under $300 you can not beat the price for what the tv offers."
If you want to subscribe to ROKU then this tv might be good for you.  It's pretty much an app specific tv.  You can't just plug it in and watch off air or cable tv.  The picture and sound are nice but there are absolutely no adjustments for either one.  I guess it's my own fault for buying a tv not knowing about ROKU specifically and I certainly will stay away from any other tv's tied to that also.  I think of it like this.  It's like buying a car that will only go to work and back if you try to drive to the grocery store the car just won't do it.
"I bought two of these TVs and one arrived broken and returned it but the other one is great. Great picture, easy setup, easy blue tooth connection so I stream videos or music from my phone, great quality with roku streaming and live tv built in. I could not ask for a better TV at this price."
I ordered on line and I picked it up from Walmart.  I decided to pick it up because several reviews said shipped and arrived broken. We took it out of the box. The tv was taped with packing tape. There were finger prints on the screen. It looks like it comes with two remotes-one of the remotes was missing and the other was broke. The screen had fingerprints it looks like it was opened and used. Going to exchange for the new one I paid for.
"My only issue is that you cannot, or at least I havent figured out how to go on a web/internet browser. My old smart LG tv would actually let you go on the Internet via Google search bar, or whatever you chose. And you could use your remote as the mouse.  This  TV doesnt have that feature. Other than that, for the price, its a good buy. Very good picture, very good sound, so, so far so good. Ive only had it for a little over a week, so if something happens in the next year or so, Ill change my review."
"I left a review months ago, now I’ve had this TV almost a year. This TV is terrible. 90% of the time I have to unplug and re plug my tv to be able to even turn it on. The apps have no sound when I initially go to them and I have to unplug the tv again and re plug in order for it them to work correctly. It’s very aggravating considering I’ve had problems since I got the tv. When I first got it it would constantly tell me no internet connection when the WiFi is working and the box in the same room. I had to unplug and re plug for that too."
"It is a great TV. I am very happy for a first time TV buyer for my apartment. The price was great, the quality is wonderful, the sound is amazing (for what I thought would be crap). It's actually loud. I only keep it on 5-12 on the volume for me to hear. Every when it is on 1, I can hear it when it's silent. I also leave in a quiet apartment complex. I have problem with sight and was worried I wouldn't be able to see the TV from my couch. I can see perfectly and so pleased."
I just bought this TV last December 2021
6 months is how long the screen will lastnon this tv. purchase the protection plan.
"Have to return, shattered on the inside once it was plugged up."
Great TV for the price…. Very happy!
The sound is not very good

Very pleased. The best picture in low  or entry level tvs in my opinion.

Very easy to connect to streaming and great picture

"Great TV, looks good and I have no problems yet"
It was a gift Maynard loved it.
Best big screen for the money . They have a surplus so lower prices to move tv inventory
TV was cracked when I got it
"The box says it is a 58 inch tv, but it is only 50 inches wide."
Awesome TV! Super easy and fast. The sound is amazing
first time opening the box this what i get.....
my delivery guy was awesome. You can tell he has moral and values. Thanks  young man!!!
"I was excited to received this brand new TV...First it was delayed for 1 day because it says the barcode is unreadable so ok next day, then the following day I was tracking it on the app finally its loaded and wait til end of the day. Fedex just left it outside the front door...although it says signature required! Well thats fine as long as they deliver it. So I arrived in the house excited rushing to see my new TV, but when I see the box woooohhh... 2 big punch holes like something a forklift or a hand truck! I felt bad already! and yeah when I pulled it out and take out the plastic or styro kind of covering, it is really damaged and it just ruined my day!!! So im really disappointed! I dnt know mishandling and poor packaging protection! Now Im returning it! Goodluck to other costumers! lesson learned if you buy a TV better pick it up in the stores personally. Thats all!"
"I had the tv professionally installed only to realize the tv was damaged. Therefore, I had to find someone new to come back and take the tv down so I could return the tv. I really did want to keep my tv but when I tried to get a replacement instead of a refund everything was sold out. This is so disappointing. I was hoping to have everything in my new home in place before I brought my newborn home."
"It's absolutely fantastic. Just love it. I would have given my 58 inch Hisense TV five stars, but I sadly found one very important feature missing. There is no Bluetooth.  Bummer, I swear I double checked this and it said Bluetooth in the Hisense 58 inch 4K TV advertising. I purchased a Bluetooth receiver which cost me 24.99 on Amazon. All good. I still love this TV. It's huge and bright and the sound for the price is more than acceptable. There are also two settings for the feet so I was able to put it on my small high table which is just great. Roku is free and there is no need for cable. I installed Pluto TV and Netflix all work great. Literally 1000s of free news, sports, movies, reality and so on. I saw many post of TV's arriving with a broken screen. I was worried, but I did not have a car big enough so I ordered it. It arrived in perfect condition. I am very happy."
"Very upset, I just purchased this tv, got it home and when I took it out the box, I noticed it looked smaller than it should. I used my measuring tape and it was 51 inches instead of 58, will be returning. Looks like a nice tv besides measurements being 7 inches."
I bought this tv 58 4K on sale at Walmart. It was great price and it stopped work in less then 2 years. Its not worth it. There no customerservice. I have tried. II barely even watch the TV. If you cantIf you cant even get anyone on the phone or respond by email as the warranty.
"This is my 2nd 58"" Hisense. The price is great, the picture, sound and options also."
Picture is great and the sound is good.
"I do not have any dislikes; therefore I like it all. It is a larger screen than I had which makes it easier to read the information concerning the program I might like to watch. I had no prior knowledge of Hisense. I liked the vibrant colors, the overall quality, and the sound. I would be happy to recommend this brand to anyone who wanted information on a Hisense TV."
"Very UNHAPPY!

Do not buy Hisense!!!
This television is trash! Wont last normal use after a while.
The price is alluring and the fancy apps but——- we've gone thru TWO in 26 months! The screen just dies while watching but still has sound?! Or it won't power on. And they, Hisense, just say, “sorry.” Because warranty is only 1 year, if you get it. Walmart should warn people about Hisense poor quality for lasting beyond a year. Don't waste your money, even it's it's half-off! DONT BE FOOLED BY PRICE AND MARKETING!"
"great service delivered on time did not expect delivery same day I  ordered.  Took  care in placing tv in secluded area.  neighbor did not realize tv had been delivered.  great service, went beyond expectations.  MANY KUDOS to staff and delivery personnel.  would not hesitate to order site unseen and delivery expectations went well beyond and great appreciate care and thoughtfulness of security inplacing tv
5 stars for ordering item and fulfilling and 5 stars to delivery personnel going above and beyond to ensuring item delivered and secure when delivered."
Doesn't work - purchased 2 of these back-to-back and both had something wrong - no scratches visible but neither had a picture; instead they both had color lines running down the screen like streaks of each color.  It's either a manufacturing issue or a packaging issue that is resulting in internal damage during the time that it is shipping to the store
We purchased our Hisense 58” smart tv in August of 2020 and it's still going strong. Picture is good and the price point is better. This is the only one of this brand we've purchased but we totally recommend it   And even if it craps out after a year or two it's inexpensive anyways.
"Amazing budget TV for an amazing price. Zero regrets with this Hisense Roku 58 inch. We had a smaller 46 inch and it was far enough from the bed in the bedroom we couldn't always see subtitles or gaming HUD when I'd play my PlayStation or Xbox. I'm older than I used to be at 42, but not that old yet.

So we started looking and found this crazy cheap priced tv. Very skeptical even for a bedroom tv as I value my money, even if it's only 260$. 

Researched and felt confident enough that it would suffice for its use. We have a nice, nearly top of the like LG OLED in the living room, so I was afraid I'd be somewhat bummed but would get used to it.

Bought the TV and am super pleased after setting it up! It's big, good looking and does games and movies great. Roku OS is great and easy to use and the panel itself seems to be very nice quality, especially for the price. Colors are are little too rich for me out of the box but there are all the settings you need to get it where you want it. I adjusted it and have it very nice now. The TV speakers are actually not too bad as TV speakers go. Seriously. Id absolutely nab a cheap soundbar with a sub (as I use with it) but you'd be fine with the TV speakers if you're just watching TV and aren't into big booms and gaming/movie type sounds. Just fiddle with the sound settings and you'll be happy enough. 

I play my old ps4 and Xbox one x and have a blast. I can actually read the text and little maps now. The wife watches Netflix and Hulu and is just as happy as she is watching the 1200 $ oled. 

If I wasn't a techy type, I'd be completely pleased with this as a main TV. I love the OLED, as it's gorgeous when it comes to blacks, but for 90% of folks, this TV will be super solid in any room. Don't expect top of the line but don't worry about being disappointed. I wasn't at all. 

Hisense and Roku have a big fan now."
We bought a 58 hisense tv in October 2021 and a year and a half later the screen is black. This tv was manufactured in August 2021 and its May 2023 and it's internally malfunctioned.  We followed all the instructions to get the screen to come on with no success and it seems to be the backlight. Its going to cost as much as a new television to have repaired. My husband called hisense service center and the lady told my husband it was past warranty and then she hung up on him. I will never buy a hisense product again. I paid $378.00 for a bad product.
"we purchased the TV on 2/25/2022 yesterday 5/17/2023 the TV broke. we've experienced the black screen effect the TV will not reset we had to go purchase a new tv. evidently the TV is outside of the one year manufacturer warranty so they will do nothing for us.  

I would not recommend purchasing this TV."
"This 58"" Hisense Roku TV is so far very similar to a 55"" Insignia Roku (from 2015?) that it replaced.  The notable exception being the more sophisticated OS saved me an hour's worth of password entry and assorted nonsensical remote button pushing upon setup."
"Worked great for 1 month....that's it...30 days. The picture was clear and clean and easy to set up and then on Memorial Weekend...just went black screen. No sound, no picture. The power light on the bottom shines red like it is supposed to, but it won't work."
"Very good chance this TV will not last more than a year. Don't believe me ? Look it up thousands of people have had it break from normal use, me included. I bought one New Years 2022 it is now broken April of 2023. Was good when working, but not worth the chance of breaking right after Manufacture warranty runs out. DONT BUY"
"This tv is pure junk! If you have a DVR and you fast forward The volume goes out and you have to shut the TV off for up to 3 minutes before the volume comes back on this is a continual thing That's been happening and I hate this TV I'm getting something else.
I never write reviews but I am so sick to death of this TV and I can't fast forward anything because my volume goes completely out it's like It's on mute."
"DO NOT BUY!!! 

Had it for barely a year and randomly started glitching out of NOWHERE. Vertical/diagonal lines blue and white all over the screen. The tv had never even been moved since setting up and we we're currently watching it when it randomly just glitched out. First time I ever bought a Hisense and will NEVER buy another one of their products again. Called customer service and they refused to do a single about it. I requested to speak with a supervisor and even then the ONLY thing she said was I would have to PAY to have one of their techs take a look at it. Terrible company."
"Purchased the Hisense 58"" Class 4k TV on December 26,2021 and loved it. Price was great, the TV itself was light, easy to put up, great picture, sound could've been a little better, but was fine. Here it is not even a year and a half later and the TV is done for. Turns on and has a black and blue screen, no sound. Since we purchased the TV is has not moved, so it hasn't been dropped, nothing has hit it. I've seen other reviews that people have had the same issue. I reached out to the company and they pretty much said I'm out of luck. My husband and I have a 55 inch Panasonic flat screen that was purchased in 2008 and we've had ZERO issues out of it. I'm extremely disappointed in Hisense and will not make the mistake of ever purchasing another one of their products. I would advise others not to purchase either, unless you are totally fine with buying a new TV once a year."
Awesome 58' inch !! It's way bigger than I thought..I thought I would need surround sound before I purchased it but I LOVE IT!!
Nice TV! Great picture and sound. Came packaged and wrapped really nice! A BIG BANG for the BUCK! I just hope that it will last me for many years…..
Just bought this today 11/28/20 and I love it so far! Great picture and sound! Super light for being a 58” tv. Highly recommended for the price $278
When I got it its missing the remote and its cracked.allso they will not let me return it bc I threw way the receipt and the Box
"As good as my tcl 6 series.  $300 tax included best deal ever.  This is my 2nd Hisense 55"" I bought the 1st one on 2012 for $850.  Good brand."
first good thing is the tv arrived undamaged. picture quality is good for the money was well worth it
Great TV and I like that there are two options for distance apart to place the feet. Set up was very easy. TV was up and running in no time.
"very easy to setup, good grey scale, good picture, just have a slight bright banding at the top and bottom, most people wont notice,"
Great TV for a playroom for the kids and to use as a display for my wife to connect her laptop to for zoom classes!
"Far exceeded my expectations.  Best picture and built in ROKU makes it awesome.  The price was awesome.  Great deal, great TV."
Everything but the fact that I didn't know it was made in 2018...it made no difference though...it has a beautiful picture and we really enjoy it.
WHY WOULD YALL DELIVER  ON MY FRONT PORCH TO WITHOUT SIGNATURE NOR COVERING THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT A TV.
My tv was not brandnew when i took it out of the box and set it up. There was an account already logged into the tv letting me know this device is refurbished. I need a discount on this purchase.
My major concern is merchants want a review before you have not had time to turn it on and give it an honest critique. Ask again in 6 months and Iwill be more than happy to review the TV. I will say after only1 week it is OK But will it last?
I purchased this to and arrived with major damage so I had it replaced. The 2nd one came with a line in the middle of the screen wherein the half of the screen seem a little darker than the other side. Returning and finding another brand.
"I bought this TV when I moved into my new house and it is perfect the size, the picture, and the sound. I like that I can download apps all the apps without having to buy a firestick or anything."
Cheap and easy to operate. However the 4K isn’t all that spectacular. For a couple hundred bucks more you can find a more vivid picture that will almost be like 3D
It doesnt have enough RCA connections. I had to use the headphone plug for audio I wanted so I always have to have my amp on but other than that it seems okay.  For the price it seems adequate.
"Dollar for dollar well worth the money. This Television really surprise me with its video, sound quality, ease of use and design. Hisense is a name that most people will not ignore.  Good job HISENSE."
"Very happy with this TV, the only problem is all functions of the remote do not translate to the Spectrum remote. I had the problem and called Spectrum and they admit to this problem."
I'm giving it 2 stars because it takes too long to get to the menu once you turn the tv on. It sits at the hisense entry forever. It has no power on or volume control on the actual tv so if I lose the remote I'm screwed. Wish I had noticed that.
"This is our second Hisense TV from Walmart.  Shipping was next day and the person that delivered was excellent!
Hisense is an excellent tv!  Don't waste your money on the fancy name tv's."
"Love this TV!! Easy to set up, easy to use.  Inputs for different devices, OTA, Cable Box, and Other Sources, plus Roku Steaming Apps. All at a fantastic price!"
This TV is perfect for the average user. The Roku allows me to watch items from my server without additional hardware. I would recommend a Roku sound bar with this TV for better sound.
"The picture is beautiful, the price was right it's easy to use but the sound is trash. It's muffled we just ordered a sound bar so hopefully that helps, if not I am returning both things and going to spend a little more on a better quality tv"
"I was easy to set up. Directions for connecting other devices were good. I have XFinity and it took me quite a while to locate it . Once I did, every thing worked out. I was able to link my XFinity remote."
"dislike because audio is bad , when you turn it on no volume only way you can get it to work unplug it wait for few second then replug then it , sometimes it won't cut off when you set the sleep timer price was great, but the tv not so much"
"I bought this TV because for I thought it was a steal, wasnt expecting the best in Terms of 4K quality and the sound of the TV but I was completely blown away. Awesome TV for an great price."
"Great buy, great quality for the price. The sound is outstanding, would only need a sound bar for simply bass. Works smooth and the picture is crisp. Amazing product for the price."
"Bad out of box - screen was messed up. Could barely notice some wierd lines when dark, but when powered up, you could see messed up colors of a large area of the screen. Returned and purchased TCL (so far so good with that one)."
"We are very impressed with this tv.  It has a great picture and the sound is amazing too.  With the help of  our teenage daughter, we were able to set it up without any problems.  Very impressed!"
"The TV so far is great all features are wonderful, the price is excellent and un beatable, any way I bought this TV about a week ago so hopefully it will stand for reasonable average time like most of the other brands."
"The tv is very nice! the picture is very clear,  and is use friendly. compared to other smart tvs, this one has definitely been number 1 in my opinion."
"This is a good tv to own. The picture quality is good and the sound is right on for movies and tv shows, not for listening to music turned all the way up."
"this is a nice tv . claims it has a voice remote , it does not come with 1. also claims to work with amazon alexa . Alexa intigration does not work well at all."
"We have had a Hisense TV for years and its painful. Restarts on occasion for no reason, slow, constant problems connecting, color issues, darkness issues, bad glare resistance. Won't buy this brand again. Its cheap and you get what you pay for."
Great TV for the price. It has everything I'm looking for. The menus are easy to navigate and the picture quality is superb. The feet it stands on have 2 positions so you can place the tv on a smaller table/stand.
"I have the Hisense 43 that we use in the back yard. So when we needed to replace our bedroom unit we went with this. It shows just as good as our 86"" LG"
The roll back price on this TV was what got me to look at this   the 4K and Roku. After setting this up I am very pleased with my purchase so far. Picture is great and it is loaded with features.
Loved the tv picture is sharp and clear I would have given 41/2 stars  didn't have the option. I hoped it had a voice activated remote control and it does not  disappointed on that but very great buy happy with purchase
This TV was a great choice for me! I needed a flat screen with a quality picture and quality sound without breaking the bank. I really feel I got what I wanted at an excellent price.
Its a very nice flatscreen. The one mailed to me was shattered when it was delivered to my home. So I suggest purchase from the store to avoid the hassle of returning.
I have only had this TV for a week but I'm very impressed with it at this point. Excellent picture quality. Easy setup. Good sound quality. I put away my Polk Audio sound bar because it's just not necessary.
Excellent tv high quality. People complaining about screen going black probably hit the button that turns the display off. Literally all the negative reviews seem to be from people who don't know tech.
Absolutely in love with this tv!! My husband and I had a 42 inch tv and now seeing the change with this 58”. AMAZING! The picture is clear and sound is great. Everything is so easy to setup . I highly recommend this product!!!
"I love this TV , its so easy with the Roku setup . My hubby loves that , plus at a press of the button we can switch to our xbox , OTA , or Mi Box .  What a great price the size and the features it has."
",
Don't care much about the remote control. It would be better if it had numbers on the remote so I can physically turn the t.v. to the channel I want to watch. T.V is too big for the average size bedroom. Just my opinion."
"So far I am enjoying my tv and have not run into any problems with it. 
It’s very nice that I’m able to access Prime Video and My Roku channels so easily."
"I love these tvs so much that I have two!
Would definitely buy again! It's fast, easy to use, and has plenty of options (channels) for all ages to enjoy."
"TV is absolute @%23$%26. Picture is ok but the synch of audio is a total fail. No matter how I try troubleshooting I cannot get the audio to synch with what's on the screen, wired or wifi."
"Shipping was quick. The TV is a good value. Comes with all smart TV features. If you don't care about the latest, this TV provides a good value for your purchase. I can only hope it'll last a few years."
"Love this tv! I was skeptical because of the brand, but I sure am glad I bought this. Tv is clear, audio is great, its big but not too big. I couldnt be happier, plus I saved money!"
"In the store the picture quality of this TV is phenomenal - get it home and the picture looks nowhere near as good!
Not sure why anybody would want ROKU, it won't let you use any browser - much better off with a non-ROKU TV.  Returning it today."
"Ive had this tv for about 3 weeks now and I love it! The sound is great, the picture is crisp and I was already used to using Roku so set up and navigation was easy for me. I would absolutely recommend especially for the price!"
A black line appeared after about a month of use. Then a second line appeared about another week after that. Entire tv stopped working after about 4 months of owning the tv. Trash!!
"Excited to get this tv. Picture and sound were great for the price, but it burnt out in 1 week. now I only have a black screen. i have had 2 other hisense tvs without issue before this. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one."
"Better than I expected. I usually buy Samsung but figured I would give this one a try. It didn’t disappoint. The picture is great. I actually like the Roku smart tv, better than Samsung’s smart tv. This one works more smoothly."
Alittle over a month an it messed up already been trying all day to get extra warranty. Been to the store talked with 3 diff. Still no luck Wal Mart sucks..
"Easy set up, very clear picture. The only problem that I have is that when I turn the tv off, then turn it back on, the tv doesn’t remember the WiFi network, and I have to keep setting it up. Small hiccup. Overall nice"
It keeps kicking me out of apps and getting worse by the day and the TV is less than 18 months old. Frustrating and it's all apps it is kicking me out from.
"Just bought today, super easy set up with roku, as expected! color is very vivid, upgraded from a 2009 47"" toshiba.  Man this thing blows it out of the water, great price!"
This Television very nice and it did not take long for delivery and I really enjoy that it has all the Roku programed in the television it self so you don't need cable just internet.
"Great value at a great price.  Got a pre- black Friday sale price of 400.00! That included tax and shipping!  The picture is great, love the built in Roku, the sound is good but could probably use a sound bar."
"Two day shipping, arrived in perfect condition. Very impressed with the TV itself for the price. Nice picture, sound, easy set up. Very simple and easy to understand for a smart TV. Love the easy/simple Remote, too."
"picture quality and features of this tv
 is identical as to the 
TCL brand 4 series. This model looks fabulous. speaker is decent .  hardly any side bezel's and  lightweight . tv box had some scuff marks after delivery."
I've only owned this tv for a little over a year and the screen just went black during a movie. The tv had no damage whatsoever. It's basically still new. It literally just went out with no warning.
"Everything about Hisense tv is easy to setup.great soud, great picture, this is my second Hisense I bought, other tv is as good as new TV,if looking for great tv buy a Hisense."
"I love this TV. This is my first smart TV. I dont have cable, but there are thousands of shows and movies to watch on this TV. You dont have to hook anything up to it, all you need is internet. If you are a streamer, I recommend this TV."
I really like this tv. The picture is clear and color is perfect. The setup was very easy and the apps you can add and that come loaded are great and convenient. The price was a steal for such a large size tv.
"For $278 dollars you get 58 inches of 4K television, need I say more, you cant go wrong with this tv. Beautiful picture, good sound, easy setup, easy controls, this purchase was a no brainer, extremely satisfied"
This TV is incredible. It's easy to use and the quality is so good! I recommend having it delivered to your place as opposed to the store. Super convenient and couldn't be happier with this product
this was a simple setup including the wifi.  have 5 streaming sites and they all setup very easily.  picture is great and sound is above average.  received with no problems via FedEx and screen was packed fine.
"This tv has an awesome picture. And like most flat panel tv's, a soundbar is needed. I would highly reccomend this tv for the price. You won't be disappointed."
"Tv arrived with a damaged screen via FedEx, no damage to the box nor any cracks in the screen, only the picture was defected. it’s taking 2 weeks to have someone come out, pick it up and process my refund. So disappointing."
I waited and researched for My only complaint is the remote could use some improvements.  The volume and mute buttons are on the side of the remote and are often pushed accidentally.
This tv was the right size needed for the space I have. The picture quality met my expectations and I am well pleased with it.  It was easy to set up and the menu on the remote is easy to use.
Great picture and colors images comes alive. Very good price save your self a lot of money and buy this tv. The Speakers are a little weak but you can buy a cheap sound bar and problem solved
Received it and it had a crack in the screen returned it they said it would take up to 2 days for the money to be credited to my account it took almost 2 weeks .
The TV is great! The nice associate that brought it to my car was the best! patient and helpful. He was so helpful! I have never done curbside pickup befor but would do it again only because of this nice young man! SUPER HELPFUL
"The TV has great picture but the remote control is laggy, it’s constantly disconnecting from the WiFi, and overall it isn’t very responsive. I wish I had waited until the Onn. Tvs we’re back in stock."
"Picture is vey clear.  Sound is very good.  Only problem is it doesn't connect with the remote with my Hotwire cable, so must use BOTH remotes for certain things."
"Excellent TV at a bargain price, l haven't made this good of a purchase in a long time and now we're streaming through our wireless and cable is gone."
"Had tv for not even 2 months and the tv doesnt come on. Thought maybe the remote needed new batteries, so i bought new ones.  The tv still doesn't come on."
"The TV was damaged, the screen was broken and missing the base legs! It was supposed to be a new item but I think it was a returned item that was resent out as a new item. Very upset"
"Love this tv!!!  You can connect with Bell Fibe through your Android unit ... Superior picture, sound, attractive unit!!! Great programming!  Looking forward to buying an9ther one for a different room!!!"
It was very easy to set up and get started. I loved every minute of it and its very nice to look at. I do suggest setting it up with an extra person so it makes it easier. Other than that I love it and very happy with my purchase
Pickup was easy however the tv was badly cracked to the point that we had to return it. Wasn't happy about that! Great size tho and I love the remote.
Picture quality is great and it is affordable but it is very laggy it kicks its self off the WiFi and freezes up a lot to the point sometimes it will have to be unplugged and plugged back in.
I love the TV so far.  The picture is out-standing and the speakers are excellent (I don't have to turn in all the way up to hear it)!!  For the price it is a very good buy.   Hopefully it will last for a while.
"Not sure the stars to give as like many others the tv came broken, entire screen was 'spider webbed"" when I turned it on. So I returned via fedex and reordered keeping my fingers crossed. New tv came in 3 days. Nice picture good sound"
Love the tv. 1 love that you can use the roku remote to stream channels and you can use your antenna to watch channel as well. Overall this is awesome tv. Thumbs up !
"The tv looked great but screen was cracked when I got it. I tried to order another one but they were out of stock. I had to get the same size tv different brand at Best Buy cause Walmart was out of the 58"" Tvs.."
"This is the second purchase of exactly the same tv from Walmart, and it is having the same issues as the first.  Flashes of light on the screen and additional flashes in which the picture is gone altogether."
"We bought 2 of these online and both came with the screen cracked internally after we plugged it in.  Then tried to buy one in the store, took it home and the wifi would not stay connected.  Not impressed at all with Hisense."
It's the best t.v.  Everything from buying it to enjoy watching it. If I had to really look hard to find something that I do not like is the remote with the volume control on the side.
"This Tv is crisp and clear and fit my tv stand that I had previously for my 50"" TV.  It's been perfect for gaming on next gen consoles and streaming and watching High quality movies."
I was afraid the price was too good to be true but the picture and sound quality are awesome so there havent been any issues so far. Glad to have found such a good deal!
Bought this over Walmart delivery. Got it and it doesn’t work. They don’t do replacements so instead of just getting another one as soon as possible I have to wait for my money to hit my card and then re order it.
"BEAUTIFUL!!!  I SENT THIS TO A BEST FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS, IT ARRIVED BEFORE CHRISTMAS, SHE WAS SO ELATED AND CRIED WITH HAPPYNESS!! GREAT PICTURE, ROKU IS A GREAT VALUE!!  PRICE IS GREAT TOO!!"
Right out of the box setup was great if you have updated phone and router.  Easy to control with remote and app on phone.  Great smart tv.  The thing Im still working on is my sound bar.
Ready to go right out of the box! Setup as simple as plugging in. I have always used Amazon Firestick but this came with Roku and Im finding I like Roku even better. You cant go wrong for this price point.
"i like this tv very much i am enjoying it, my freinds are waiting for an invite for movie night. i googled what the best roku are, and it said hisense so i went for it. im glad i did.
so far so good"
"I like the size and sound quality of this television.  the picture is clear it give you option to choose the picture quality, theater, normal etc.  Just what I need."
I was watching it and had a perfect picture and it shut down like I turn it off but never did anything else. The company said there only made for a year my friends went out hours apart. It did same thing. My daughter hers acts up and there looking for another brand. Yes we bought at same time over holidays.
"I called the driver and asked if he's my delivery driver and he said no. Then he openly left my tv in front view to be stolen instead of putting it behind the garbage can. That's why I left it there. I better have my tv when I come
Home from work. Especially since you were supposed to drop it off last night."
"Got this Tv because of the great price but of course you get what you pay for. I was watching tv all fine, then all of a sudden the screen went black. I’ve tried resetting it a number of ways but it seems maybe something went out? It shows a slightly illuminated black screen."
"I love the Hisense 58"" TV! It has amazing picture quality and sound for the price, and it's so easy to use with Roku. I can watch all my favorite shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, Disney . I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great 4K smart TV at an affordable price."
"We have had this TV for several years.  It's really a good TV for the price. I'm positive it would've lasted a lot longer had it not fallen off the stand and screen broken (toddler trying to touch her favorite characters in her shows... she didn't get hurt, thank God).

On that note,  I highly recommend hanging it if you have small children and a short tv stand. The legs support the TV good, but need a wide base to stand on. 

I'm actually purchasing another to replace it. We use it with a Vizio sound bar and all streaming services with Roku. It's really a great purchase and I highly recommend this TV, especially for the price."
The hisense 58in 4k tv is a good buy on a budget.Bought for a backroom and connected a PS5 and an XBOX one s and the picture quality is very good but for these tvs make sure u get the warranty cuz they always go out after a year or 2 so for 310 bucks i got this tv with a 4 year warranty.the games plays smooth and roku was an easy setup
"The price, and it was delivered free from my local Walmart, and showed up in perfect condition.  I tried to  do this last year and it was shipped via UPS from a distribution center in California, twice it arrived with broken screen. I returned it twice but third time I just took a refund and gave up."
Don't waste your money after a couple months this Y. Just starts acting weird. Doesn't wanna open apps freezes so much and even turns off by itself. I saw the prize and got it right away and even got my mom one after 1 week hers just automatically stop opening the apps. Don't let the price fool you
"Great Tv. I got this one for a deal, and didn't expect much. I was surprised how smoothly it works and how easy it is to navigate. I have had no problems with this TV. I can easily recommend it. Also, the remote is simple and easy to use. I love Roku remotes."
"Buyers Beware!!!
I purchased this 58”Hisense  tv from Walmart,,,.,A year and a half’s time precisely it went out on me … screen went black completely the tv would come on but the screen was completely blacked out! I called and of course my warranty was up and there was nothing that could be done…I was out of $300 and a T V in my living room….. Hisense TV’s  Don’t last long at all so beware…. I’m so frustrated and disappointed,,,..Please Purchase another brand!!!"
Bought this tv at the end of July 2020 and it is totally done beginning of March 2023. Apparently there's a known issue where you get the black screen of death.  Roku advised it's a hardware problem and referred us to Hisense…so far no response from them. I don't think less than 2.5 years is reasonable for the life of a tv.
"I just had to comment on 58"" 4K Hisense I just bought. I returned the Samsung  65"" because the picture wasn't as good as the 58"" 1080p Hisense I sold to my roommate, to buy the Samsung. this 4k Roku is amazing. The picture is beautiful. I can't believe how they could sell this at Walmart for $268 !!!"
"arrived in a well packaged box, from ky local store via same day delivery. arrived in a box with excess styrofoam protectionn, and it was safe and intact. setup was very easy, basic for todays modern electronics setup. i did opt jn for the 5yr protection plan But as of day one we have a great tv..thank you!!"
"Great deal for a 58"" TV. Great picture. I love the integrated ROKU. My only only complaint is that the volume controls are funky. Even thoug the volume goes up o 100, it doesnt seem to get louder above 30. It is plently loud enough, it just seems hard to find the right volume because you can go from too quiet to too loud in 1 or 2 clicks. When watching a movie I have to constanly adjust volume between conversations and action scenes. I have tried all the different audio settings with no luck. I did not have this issue with the VISIO that this TV replaced. Overall, I am still happy with the TV."
"A nice upgrade from my 20 year old 32” Vizio.  I don’t have ultra high definition service to my home so the picture on some channels isn’t super “crisp “ but it’s still as good as my older tv.  And most channels are better than my older tv. 
The instruction manual didn’t explain how to customize the picture settings and size etc.  But I figured out that the asterisk button took me into those areas.  You definitely want to program the contrast, sharpness, backlight,color and tint by going to fine tune picture settings. 
Also depending on your cable box , antenna or direct cable you may need to go into the picture size settings to get the picture to use the full screen.  Mine required the zoom setting…..the normal picture setting that is the factory setting only used 44” of the 58”screen. 

But all things considered, this tv is a really nice product and it was a super bargain. I don’t think you’ll find another one this good for under $300. I couldn’t be happier with the price that I paid for a very nice television."
"This TV was cheap and nice when it worked, It lasted for about 8 months, tried to get warranty service (they say manufacture warranty is for a year) but they just keep having me jump through hoops with no action.  Just go with the better manufactures if you have the money, you'll save a bundle in the end."
"This is not a 58 inch TV. It's 51 inches to be exact. I was very disappointed thinking I was getting one thing and really getting something totally different.
The manufacturer of this brand needs to be ashamed of themselves for pulling the okie doke on consumers w/ this noticeably not 58 inch TV."
"Surprisingly good quality for the price! We were looking to replace our old 42” Roku smart tv in our bedroom, because it constantly disconnected from the internet. My husband bought an upgraded 58” and now like watching a movie at a drive-in movie theater in bed. It’s so big. Great picture and sound quality, zero connectivity issues. The only hiccup we had, was when hubby bought the first one, and mounted it, turned it on and the picture was very distorted. Guessing something happened during shipping. But we took it to Walmart the next day to exchange it, which was very easy. And no issues with the second TV."
"Beware... You get what u pay for...Cheap TV... doesn't last. Bought this TV Nov 2021 and I was watching TV and the screen just went black. Unplugged it %26 it came back on and blew out again. I actually loved the roku %26 ease of the App downloads... However,  I have had my Samsung flatscreen for 7 years %26 no problems to date...."
"I've had 2 Hisense TV's, they both lasted 14-16 months with regular use. I'd suggest getting an extended warranty! Besides that, they're ""decent"" tv's. Picture quality isn't the best, and it does lag a bit at times. The internal hard drive is extremely small and at some point you'll be deleting apps just to add something else. If you're looking for a TV just to get by, this will be great for that. Otherwise, I'd suggest paying a little more for better, lasting, quality."
Tv was great if i woukd have been able ti watch it! Tv arrived damaged i would suggest not using fedex to deliver. Took to walmart and got money back.
"item was delivered by fed ex. no physical damage in the packaging box. but after taking the tV out of the box, immediately noticed the screen was hit with something on top left corner, got cracked and that area got damaged and warped"
"baught this tv in the store. box wasnt damaged,  drove it home in my toyota sequai. plugged it in and NOTHING but a hair scratch digital line across the screen.  Huge disappointment."
I have this tv since September 2020 last week of September it came messed up don’t work and I lost the receipt so I can’t take it back smh  someone returned the tv and then I bought it and come to find out it’s messed up
word very well
"Good value, great TV"
"Great price , easy use and set up"
"Standard Roku Software Platform, Fit Seamlessly into my Condo/Duplex/Townhouse."
It's good for the price I got it for on black Friday. I'm loving it
Love it. Caught it on sale. Got it for pick up. 338$. It’s so clear!!
I highly recommend this television.  Ive had no problems with it at all.
Easy to set up and it had great clarity and color. It has lots of apps I can use
Awesome best tv I have ever had
"Great tv, especially for price."
Love it  turned my house into a home ️ a must buy the price was right as well
i love every second of this!
Just mounted my 58 inch tv.  I am loving it so far. It was easy to program and use.
A great Gift for the Husband..Thank you Dear.
Love my tv perfect size perfect deal!!
For the price its a great tv
Beautiful t v. at a GREAT price. Sound
"Bought TV twice, got broken ones both times. Do not buy."
Big enough for the whole family to watch. Great 4K Resolution.
Really like the easy set up. Very good tv for the price.
Love this TV!!!! Great picture great size and I love roku. Great purchase
"I did not realize that this tv had Roku, they ask for too much info just to get started. I did not like having to surrender my personal info just to make the tv work."
OMG! I am in love with this TV like seriously!! The price was a steal!! %26 it also sounds and looks good! I would def recommend getting one I'm not the type of person to leave reviews but I had to on this one!
I loved the Direct Delivery the guy and the girl were amazing they made sure that I got my package in hand they just went above and beyond three thumbs up for those two
She was the absolute best not only was she conceded for the safety of the tv but also wanted to make sure i got the best experience from this possible. Would recommend her 10/10
"The Screen turned black while watching… this is really disturbing… not sure, how working television can turn screen off black. Only audio is available for now"
Pretty nice tv! A little bigger than what I thought but it's pretty nice upgrade from a 43 to 58 in the bedroom! I think I like Hisense better than my lg and samsung tv!
"Can't watch local channels!!!
I asked the employee if it would play local channels and he said yes, but no.
I'm returning it 1st thing tomorrow morning."
"Excellent TV for the design, size, and price. I was not crazy about the new legs, but once you place them on a stand, it is fine. The remote is a little basic, but it comes with a price."
"I've owned this TV for 4 months now and am really impressed.  For the price it's really hard to beat.  The Roku feature is really nice I'm a big fan of Roku before I bought this anyways and if you haven't used Roku before you'll love it.  The 4k picture is amazing as well as the HDR and Dolby Vision if you have Disney  watch a movie in HDR and your jaw will drop.  Love that it has multiple HDMI inputs.  A big bonus that many newer TVs don't have this one still does is the red, yellow, and white composite inserts.  This makes it nice if you still have older electronics such as a Nintendo Wii or VCR.  I've recommended this to everyone I've talked to."
"Great tv! Wonderful size...58"" in your livingroom is much bigger than the instore display. Very nice picture; sharp, bright, clear colors that pop out at you. I read alot of negative reviews about its sound system so I bought a soundbar w/mount to attach it to tv.  After hooking it up and turning it on, I immediately boxed the soundbar up to return to Amazon. I'm so pleased that I wished I'd bought another for my bedroom,  but I got the last one in the store. No...its not a Samsung, but for the price $278, I dont believe you can find a better tv at this size[58""] and a beautiful 4K picture and 120Hz motion rate...So, if you can find one available...GRAB IT IMMEDIATELY!!!"
"This is my second Roku built-in TV and so far it's been great. It's my first Hisense branded TV and the picture has been rock solid. It's replacing an 8 year old plasma in my bedroom and I had a small sound bar hooked up to it. I'm currently using the audio from the Hisense TV and it does the job pretty well. It's not going to replace a home theater surround setup but that's not what I'm using it for. I jumped on the cord cutter bandwagon recently and haven't looked back. Having access to all my entertainment options through the apps on one screen is really convenient and I've discovered some good content through the Roku channel app too. Hisense is becoming a real player in the market and now I see why. Of course I can't speak to the longevity of this TV past the manufacturers warranty so I went ahead and got the additional 3 year protection plan. For the total price, I think it's a fantastic bargain."
"Picture is as good as some that are twice the price of these. Tv fills the need in a large family room. The sound from the tv is is very good. As of yet not even thinking of having to add a sound bar. It also has an rca input for an older style dvd player that you don't see on most new sets anymore.
very pleased with this purchase and recommend it."
"This is my second Roku TV. Had a TCL S series before it got damaged. This is a big improvement in the picture because of Full Array. Roku is fast and the picture is really good. Setup takes about 5 mins for all my channels to be available.  The USB has dual purpose. you can add a USB drive to pause , rewind live OTA TV and if you put in a USB with media on it, you can play the media files. Overall, this is a fantastic TV for the price.  I hope it lasts at least 5 years. ( i have taken extended warranty, just to be safe)"
"Had this tv for a few days and far so good!! Picturenis really nice and sound is good for this kind of tv. You may want to adjust some of the audio and video settings though as this seems to help. The TV wasnpackaged wel and had no damage to the box oe TV itself. It appears to be the newer model as wel, as the production date says March 2020 and that it was made in Mexico, not China. Overall, happy with the purchase so far!"
"I am utterly impressed by this TV. It was only $278 delivered (excluding sales tax); I ordered it on a Monday and it arrived on the Thursday, as promised. I thought I was going to receive a phone call to confirm the delivery given my signature was supposed to be required but I received an email at 2:30pm to say it'd been delivered and when I returned home at 7pm it was - thankfully - still there.  I do feel a bit lucky about that, given I live in a cul-de-sac and the box was blatant publicizing the a 58"""" TV. My neighbors joked that I'm lucky they're honest and didn't swipe it.\n\nI've had the TV for a week and am very pleased. I will be wholly disappointed if anything changes! I was nervous from the past reviews that it'd arrive damaged but it was fine. The set-up was incredibly easy. All my favorite apps are now on it - either pre-installed or by me.\n\nThe integrated ROKU is fantastic. I was going to buy a ROKU stick for the TV this one relegated and that costs $50 so I actually see this TV as only costing me around $200.\n\nI cut my cable chord last year, which saves me around $70/month; with a TV like this I can't imagine ever going back to cable. I can't wait for the pandemic to be over so I can show it off to my friends!"
"Im not a tv expert by any means. I bought this tv because of the size/price. Ive had it for 1 week now and Im not disappointed with what I got. Picture quality is great in my opinion and the sound coming from the speakers is actually good.

Also, it was shipped fedex and surprisingly it arrived in working condition. The box was a little banged up but everything worked and in great shape. Hisense packaged their tv well.

The tv with roku works like any other tv with roku. I have a 50 inch TCL and its the exact same layout. Though the remote on that tv is more responsive. Very minor gripe.

I paid $294 after taxes. For a 58 inch tv.  Overall, I like my purchase though I was a little hesitant at first because of the brand but not anymore."
"Cannot stream itunes music without first downloading all the songs. Really silly. I just want a TV that can stream my music also. Also it's a thick 2012 tv, the base without the legs are around 3.5"" thick. Will be returning and buying a samsung smart tv."
We've had our TV for about a week and we have been due for a new one for a while. We love it. My fiance plays Xbox and the picture for the and regular TV is very clear. The sound is perfect. We love it so much! The only thing I think I would slightly complain about is the delay when you turn it off or switch an app is a little slow. But nothing we can't handle. Over all a great TV for a great price!
"Literally AMAZING TV for the price! This one is literally on par with my 4K samsung and has a better OS (Roku) and better sound, and Dolby HDR. Literally blacks look a deep black. We keep the sound no more than 30 volume because it is so loud, clear, and booming! I used this to replace our older Hisense and again Hisense made an excellent TV at an unbeatable price. Seriously guys you will not regret this purchase at all!"
"I am happy with the TV, but when I connected the TV to the internet, it tried to force me to sign up for Ruko.  I do not want Ruko.  The manufacture need to fix this BUG.  I live in America where we enjoy the freedom to choose.  Do not try and take my freedom from me.  Fix the BUG"
"Just like other reviews the tv arrived broken. I suggest not ordering online just go to the store and buy that are available at the store. You will save yourself the time and effort. I'm very disappointed because I was looking forward to this TV. Also, I ordered for store pickup and it took two weeks. I pick it up take it home to find out it's broken. Had to return and bought one at the store 55"" TCL for the same price as this one but at least it wasn't defective. Manager told me a lot of TVS ordered online are coming broken. Do not buy online go in the store and if you can open the box in the parking lot to make sure tv is not broken."
"Unfortunately it had a small crack when delivered. I would have been fun with a small crack except when turned on, the picture didnt come up at all. Had to send back which is a huge inconvenience. Definitely should have read the 1 star reviews here since theyre all saying the same thing - this company doesnt know how to package their TVs for delivery!"
"I have had this TV for over a year now and I have had no problems. I have received numerous comments on the great color and it does wotk with voice remote, but you need to supply the remote. i already have one and it works perfectly.  I noticed that virtually every complaint involved shipping or a screen problem. Maybe the shopping company should be rated instead because they are the reason a review cannot be left for how the tv works. The lines and screen problems are most liklely caused during the unpacking by putting too much pressure in the wrong places. They are very clear about that in the instrutions up front. i was able to pick mine up so no delivery problems or damage. All in all I am very satisfied with this product and I would recommend it for purchase and I would buy it again."
"Manufacturer warranty is for 1 year, after 13 months from purchasing the Hisense 58 inch the television stopped working. The screen disappeared while watching and now only shows a black screen. I bought a different brand smart television even though this was only 13 months old. Picture, sound, quality was great when it worked. No issues except their TV's stop working immediately after the warranty expires."
I bought 3 of these TV's in August and installed it in October.  2 of the 3 TV's worked.  One is defective. I am trying to return it and am being told the period of time has expired. Now I am sitting with a $300 TV that doesn't work and am extremely dissatisfied.  Looks like this is my last purchase with Wal-Mart.
"Purchased the TV in store, brought it home and left it in the box for 10 days , when we finally decided to set it up we turned it on and the screen was cracked, well my husband bought it paid cash and didn’t have the receipt, sick to my stomach I went to the store in Carnegie, Pa  where he had bought it, I didn’t take the TV  because it was to big for me to handle alone, went to the service desk and explained what had happened, thinking they would say you need your receipt, to my surprise they were so nice to me and told me to bring it in and they would replace it. I was so happy I don’t think any place else would have done this. The young girl her name was Jess, who was the dept lead in that department was amazing, and so very kind , I hope she goes way to the top, she deserves it, love my TV and Carnegie Pa  Walmart !!!!!!!"
"So I purchased the TV last year and sometime last year we had our power go out and the Internet went out as well. When everything came back on and was reset I went to turn on the TV and it wouldn’t connect to the Internet and I didn’t know why, when my kids TV was able to connect back to the Internet and it’s been like this for almost a year. It still won’t connect to the Internet, I have unplugged it for weeks and reset it and it still won’t work.. Highly frustrating and disappointed when you spend your hard earned money on something and it fails and doesn’t work."
"I did NOT buy this TV to be used as a ROKU system. I hooked it up to my cable box. And because of that every time I turn the TV on I have to use the ROKU remote control to scroll over in settings to cable box. Picture quality is quite good. Speakers are bad for it's size. Had to buy a whole new Soundbar Surround System.

I've had it about 6 weeks and am satisfied overall."
Stop! Don't buy. Very low quality. I bought one in Nov 2021. Two third of the screen becomes white when I turn it on now. The manufacturer only provides 1 year warranty. It is broken barely after one year. Never see such a low quality TV before. It is a cheap TV but will cost you more eventually.
"Extremely frustrating TV, if you play video games or like to watch uninterrupted video this isn’t the tv for you. Have factory reset the television and changed every setting to not shut everything off but the TV will cut off in the middle of a game and take your gaming device with it. Auto shutoff features that can’t be disabled are this televisions bane. Gravity pulls your HDMI cords, have tried countless new ones,  eventually this pulling will cause a momentary signal loss shutting the tv and anything connected to it off. Can’t connect it to a computer either as it does the same thing, slightest movement causes everything to shut off. Will never buy another Hisense smart television. Don’t normally write reviews but I think everyone deserves to know the severity of the trash you will endure by purchasing this tv. Graphics are wonderful, just wish it had the ability to stay on."
"The picture is great.  It’s nice and clear images but the remote control to change channels doesn’t have numbers.  So if you want to change channels you have to go up or down and that is kind of a headache to go back through all the channels to get to the channel you want.  Other than that, the tv is great."
"Tv lasted us exactly two years before a major hardware malfunction left it completely unusable. Hisense did not offer any help with fixing it, warranty, or even an apology. Im more upset with the customer service than the TV problem. If you buy a Hisense TV plan on throwing it in the garbage the first time you have an issue. Not worth even trying to call. I will never buy a Hisense TV or give positive remarks on one ever again. I should have known better buying a $300 black Friday special."
TV is awesome price is way well worth it the only thing I had a problem with is setting up my roku their representative tried to sell me a free service and caused me to cancel my card they sent me a email to set up my account and wanted to charge me 94.99 to have roku for life or 49.99 for 5 years they said because it was a new tv they was using the name pc fix solutions ltd
"I bought this television and was thrilled with the size and picture quality. BUT... after watching it three times, we picked it up to move it to another room, and the plastic screen popped out and cracked just from hand pressure. Walmart wouldn't take it back, and Hisense refuses to discuss it because it is ""damaged"". their bad workmanship and cheap materials made this the most expensive 2 hours of television I have ever watched."
"I've been buying Hisense since my 1st 1080 LCD in 2012. Great tvs. Reasonable price. Never had an issue. With regular use, the tv lasts about 5 or 6 years. My 55"" 4K Hisense I bought in 2017 was still running this yr, but the colors got a bit wonky so I bought the 58"". Easy to use and set up. UI is straight forward since it runs on Roku. Everything is right there. 4K is cool. Colors are solid. No Issues."
I will never buy this brand of flat screen tv EVER.  Bought March 21 to December 22...the power has blown out. We had the one year warranty and we tried the troubleshooting steps for the tv to reboot itself to no avail....$300 gone. I guess that what 1 year and 8 mths gets you.
"I have not had any issues with the tv so far. The set up was very easy. I purchased the tv in store and I’m only giving 3 stars due to the fact that I didn’t have the option to purchase an extended warranty at the time of purchase, in fact none of these tv at my local store gives the option to purchase an extended warranty. I had to go through 3rd party to protect my tv."
My mom purchased this online. When we got it there were red streaks down the middle and a weird design in the top right corner. When we called high sense to tell them they said we had to call the manufacturer. The manufacturer told us it was something on the inside and basically there’s nothing they can do. This TV cost over $300 with the warranty and I just believe this is bad business.
"It was great while it lasted, which was 2 years, 2 months.  When you do the math on this less expensive unit, as compared to something more expensive, with higher quality, you're paying the same, if not more in trade to pay less in the initial purchase.  Unit gave warning by having power surges and losing significant brightness.  This now begs the question, seems I paid 125. per year, roughly for this tv.  do I want to soend more to get more time out of the unit, and if so, how much time will I get?  Do I care enough about tvs in landfills to buy one for 900. to hopefully get a return of less than 125. per year, hopefully 9 years at least.  and at that rate...will I want a 9 year old tv, or will anyone else if I attempt to resell?  I think I'll be going up to the 500. rage for a unit this size next round."
"This TV is like no other that I have had in the past. When I unbox this TV I noticed that the remote control did not have any numbers and that it was a roku remote and I was kind of skeptical to the workings of it. This is the first TV I've ever gotten like this and when I turned it on and messed with it I noticed the way the TV setup was with the Roku and everything else you hook to it didnt require numbers on the remote and I think that the way Hisense and Roku set this TV up is pure genius. You have three HDMI ports and then you can hook an antenna to get free channels and a bunch of Roku apps including the Roku Channel that offer very heavy content of endless viewings. Once I realized how this TV was set up, I was just taken. Apparently this was a black Friday sale TV but I believe that anybody who purchases this TV will be very satisfied regardless the size 43, 50, 58, 65 because it will all do the same as I mentioned."
not good for streaming we have had so much problems with it losing the channels shutting off the channels restarting it works good for antenna top channels but when you're on the internet using an app it drops a lot of apps and restarts all the time and there's nothing wrong with my high speed internet
"I wish i had listened to the other reviewers. Maybe this tv works great if it doesnt come broken. I will never know! I cant blame a delivery company wither as I picked this up in the store myself. We handled it so carefully and when we turned it on, the screen was clearly busted."
Great tv for me.  My biggest concern was I wanted it to have live TV Pause.  It does.  USB thumb drive in the back.  Great.  Set up very easy.  found live tv digital channels and digital/streaming channels.  I am a cord cutter and use an over air antenna.  Works great no cable bills.
"If I didnt have to put a star I wouldnt. Only had 6mnths. Color going out tv malfunctioning. Always do your research outside of companies websites before you decide to purchase items. I DO NOT RECOMMEND, even with insurance, after you get a new tv, it is unable to be covered again."
"Built in Roku is great (have many other Roku's throughout the house).
The picture quality is extremely good, nice and sharp @ at both HD and 4K.
Sound is a wee bit tinny, but still very good for not using a soundbar. (Much better than on my LG or Vizio.)"
"Back of tv shows made Oct 2019, I bought new Feb 2020.    It is broken as of beginning of Dec 2022.   Got repair estimate and to me it's not worth paying for repair.   
While it was working I did like the menu and direct use of apps, etc.   Audio was fine, pic was avg to below avg ( colors such as red seemed off a bit no matter how you adjust settings).    
Was initially great size for the money aside from the below avg picture quality.    But in the long run not lasting even 3 years is kinda annoying no matter what you pay.   
For that I give it a 2 star rating, if it was still working I would say it is a 3 or maybe even 4 star item because of its low price.  Would never be 5 stars cause of quality issues.   
Hope this helps, maybe buy it because it is cheap and hope it lasts."
"My expensive LG TV lasted 2 years, I needed to replace it and didn’t want to spend a lot of money. Found this TV that had good reviews for under $300 so I decided to give it a try. I’m not disappointed one year later. Good picture quality and the Roku smart functions work excellent. Only slight negative as with any cheap TV the edges of the picture are a little washed out with bright shadowing. Only noticeable if you look close and are used to high end tvs. I highly recommend this tv for someone in the market for a value tv that won’t break the bank. It’s no Sony XBR but it’s $300 not $3000.  Buy it!"
"Great TV, not the darkest blacks but color is on point. Can't beat roku TV operating system. Occasionally goes on sale so I would be patient. Don't pay full price for this TV, better options available, but once discounted this is the cheapest 4k TV between 55 and 60in when I purchased in december '22."
"have a 3D Samsung I bought back in 2012, and it's still going strong. I bought this to replace a TCL Roku after 1.5 yrs, and it worked fine. I know it's not a high end, but for the money, it's not bad. Thank God, I bought the extended warranty from Walmart bc it lasted 2.5 yrs. After a rediculous amount of phone troubleshooting with someone who barely spoke English, they gave me a full refund, so I just bought the same TV again. They seemed to have upgraded somewhat, bc there are new settings and features. We'll see, if she lasts longer this time, I'll readjust the star rating."
"Do not buy! I purchased mine April 2021 and I have had problems since the beginning, starting with exiting out of the apps randomly, volume goes out and the color in the screen goes out. All requiring you to turn it off and on a few times to fix it. I tried to attach photos but it gives an error message."
"The television has a great design, but after attaching the legs and plugging it up the screen did not work correctly. There were different colors on the screen as if it had been damaged. Not sure if it may have been dropped when delivered. The box looked fine and the screen was not cracked."
"love the tv remote, not so much as it doesn't have numbers to change channel only up and down button. no voice remote. If you want to change the channel, you need to keep pressing the channel button : for example on on channel 12 and i want to watch channel 66, I then must go to every channel before getting where i want to be."
"This was a great tv for about 2 years, but now the screen has gotten darker despite the highest brightness settings.  Nightime scenes in movies are almost completely black and normal program is unsatisfactory.  However, $150 for a year is not too bad.  Sorry to have to replace it."
Low quality. It freezes up and runs so slow I have to unplug it to get it to work again. Thus happens frequently. Picture quality is very poor. I paid $440 for a Samsung almost the same size and it's in a completely different league. Don't buy this TV. You're better off with a slightly smaller TV from a reputable company.
Had bought one of these for a Christmas present for my father and was broken when I turned on the TV.  You could only tell it was broken when it was plugged in. I did a return and was sent another one as a replacement and was broken just as the first one!
"Trash!!!The TV turns off while you’re watching it every time! I bought a 50” Panasonic as a Christmas present for my grandson which arrived broken.  when we returned it Hisense was the only 50” in stock. It does not stay on. My son misplaced the receipt and now I’m stuck with this. Walmart won’t take it back because it’s over 30 days, Hisense won’t help me Without a receipt that shows the taxes that I paid on the TV."
"Purchased this Tv 7 months ago and it will not work properly now. Whenever any app is being used, such as Netflix or Disney+, it will automatically switch back to the Home Screen or just outright freeze. The audio is usually off from the video. I know it is the TV because when I run it through my PS4, this does not occur."
"At first I loved this tv.. bought it 10/2020.. yesterday 12.26.22 I was watching tv then it reverted back to it's ""home page"" and four corners of tv turned black and now the tv backlight is so dark.you can'tdo anything with it. waste of money! I shouldn't have wasted my money on this TV. I will never buy this brand again!"
"As for shopping that was fine, but my mom was trying to pay for this so I could pick it up at my store, but you guys kept cancelling it. I don't know why, but you did. She lives in California and I here in TX, not sure why.  I already don't like ordering things online and this just didn't help."
"This TV didn’t last a year. The screen went black but there was still sound. I called Hisense to report the issue. The representative started a warranty claim. I called back a couple days later to check on my warranty claim, and they had no record of it. I started the warranty claim for the second time. After providing them with proof of purchase, they informed me they were ordering a part and having it shipped to me. Once I received it, I was supposed to call Hisense back so they could schedule a tech to come to my house to fix it. I never received the part. Instead, I received a text message from a random number asking if they could come by to fix my TV. I confirmed with Hisense that this person was their tech and that they had shipped the part to the tech. The tech arrived and tried to repair the TV. The part did not fix the issue, so he “field destroyed” (scratched the screen) the TV and took it with him. I waited a couple days and called Hisense to check the status of the claim. They are shipping me a new TV but the warranty will only be good for a year from the purchase of my FIRST TV which is in 5 weeks. A $500 product should last longer than 8 months. I’m done with Hisense."
"I ordered 4 of these 58"" TV's.  The first 3 work perfectly but the 4th was cracked upon opening the box.  Walmart 30 day return policy was already up so I'm going to have to eat the cost of this TV.  Appears there are other people who have had cracked TV's upon shipment.  If possible buy this from another supplier."
"We bought this TV in December of 2019. Has worked great the whole time, we loved the built in Roku and all of our streaming channels. Fast forward to today (2 weeks after our extended protection plan expired, quite the coincidence) the TV is just black. The LED power light is on, blinks and looks like it's trying to do something, but the TV is just black. Did all kinds of troubleshooting and a hard restart with the reset button the back of the TV, nothing. Hisense Support says to call a technician, there's nothing they can do. A $300 TV only lasting 3 years is just unacceptable. Would not buy again and would not recommend."
I really like the quality of the tv. It has a great picture and all of the options it offers the user is unbelievable. It makes it convenient in so many ways. From mirroring what is on my phone to endless shows and movies to watch for free through the Roku. I was pleasantly astonished at the amazing picture it provides ehile watching a program in 4k.
Good quality tv . Great Price. Logistics suck tho I order my tv's (2) on a Sunday with 2 day shipping didn't get my first one till Friday of the following week and I still have not received my second one. would not recommend ordering anything from Walmart.com
"I purchased the 65"" when it was in the low $400's and the picture on the 65"" version 4 is outstanding and simply unbelievable for the price.  I got the 58 inch because of it at $315.00 and I am giving it 5 stars because of the price.  For $315, it is unbeatable.  The sound, ease of use and set up, the brightness and colors are AWESOME!  I have noticed there is a little drag on active sports events, which I believe I can adjust.  But overall, at $315, this is the best $315 TV I can possibly imagine.  It is not perfect by any means, although close, but the price is perfect for what you get.  Nobody would regret this purchase!"
"Got this tv on Black Friday sale for our living room, we got one this same brand 3 inches smaller almost 5 years ago and love it but we wanted a new one and put the old one in our bedroom. Hooked it up and the picture quality was 100 times worse on the new one same brand as the old one. We packed it back up and returned it and got the LG 55 in on sale for $50 more. Don’t waste your money."
We totally Love our Hisense Tv Equipped with Roku Tv the UHD is amazing the and sound quality is Super.. Hands down one of the best tv brands that I’ve bought so far I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a big size tv 58” it’s great quality and budget friendly everyone can enjoy..
"For around $350 after shipping and add-on warranty, this is by far, one of the best budget 4K TVs. 

The most shocking thing about this unit is the speakers, I am blown away by the quality of the onboard speakers. 

Picture is great and Ive had zero issues with gaming on this tv. The apps available for it are a wide variety and work flawlessly so far. Thank whatever higher being that made sure The Criterion Channel was available. 

Only issue Ive had which is an obvious one is edge bleed, but thats to be expected from a non oled screen and only noticeable if you look for it during darker scenes. 

They do promote the 120 motion, which unfortunately you can not change or even find a setting for it. But thankfully this does not have the ultra smooth effect that honestly turned me off of a lot of HD TVs a few years ago."
"It's a decent TV. The Roku OS is a little slow and clunky. And you have to have your phone handy to log into a TV provider for Fox, CBS, ESPN, etc. Why can't Roku be like Firesticks - with a built in browser to complete all of that just using the remote. Anyway, make sure you hook up an antenna and switch to Live TV and do a channel search. (might not even have to have an antenna) I did that 2 years after I got the TV and the channel search found 1,000 channels! Of course 99.99% of them are just streaming channels. But they're free and there's tons of good content to be found. 4K media is hit"
There was issues with the speaker straight out of the box. I already went through so much hassle to get it in the first place! The delivery driver DAMAGED the first 65 inch one that I bought and it was a nightmare trying to return it. Then I had to settle for this one because the 65 inch ones were out of stock! Honestly if not for the speaker issue its a pretty good tv
"I made a purchase of the Hisense Roku television because of the clarity of one that I have had since 2020.  I need a television for my waiting room at the office, so I went out and purchased a 58"".  The clarity was so amazing that I went out a week later and purchased another one.  The size, picture quality and the price are just amazing and unbeatable."
Tv didn’t even last 1 year. Bought the tv in April  2022 for my birthday by December 2022 the tv was no longer working. I noticed a line stared to appear across the screen 6 months into having the tv.. this sucks. I definitely will not be buying after $300  down the drain.
I would not recommend. I first purchased a Hisense in 2019 and it was great but I end up selling it because I was moving. When I moved into my home last year in June I purchased another Hisense. It was doing great at first then it began to glitch a lot especially on Netflix. A month or so ago it went completely black but I could still hear the background. I unplugged it then it was ok again but still glitched back sometimes. Now it goes black and freezes and still glitches. I know I’m going to have to purchase another tv soon. Money is wasted and it’s only been a little over 1 year. I’ll never buy another Hisense again. I should’ve read the reviews first and believed them smh.
"Overall, I liked the TV. Had a decent picture quality and was a decent price. However, have had the TV for a little over 2 years, no incidents or bumps, and the picture just randomly went blank on me. Can hear what is going on, but can’t see anything on the screen. Of course it is no longer under warranty and was told it would cost around $200 to repair, and really not worth repairing. Bummed to spend $300 for something that only lasted 2 years."
The TV was great until it stopped working after 8months. I didn’t get a warranty so I can’t return it and don’t have the receipt but it’ll act like it turns on but there’s no sound and the screen is black. Roku probably overheated and killed the motherboard.
We bought this tv almost 3 years ago. It has worked great up until recent months. It started freezing on me so I would turn it off and back on and that usually corrected the issue until 2 days ago when it wouldnt turn on at all. I was 2 months shy of the 3 year protection plan ending but got reimbursed for the tv. Honestly for the price its a great tv and lasted 3 years with no issues. I will buy this Tv again.
"if you buy this brand make sure you get the warranty, I'm so glad i did ive had to replace the TV 3 time's now in 1 year due to the screen will go black but you can still hear it. would NOT recommend  the worst tv I've ever bought and it takes hisense forever to replace it."
"Junky tv and customer service. It’s not connected to the WiFi right since day 1. It’s a software issue that won’t update, I’ve fought their customer service lines over and over between Roku and Walmart and the brand. It’s trash and I never get help they just keep bouncing me around. We finally got a chrome cast to connect to it because nothing in the “smart tv” system actually works. Do not buy."
So I purchased this in the store but I didn't realize that you have to buy the Roku separately and also the legs that you put on the bottom of the TV don't stay on and there's no screws so I'm not sure what to do. I guess it's a good price for a TV but yeah I currently have it and can't even watch it because I didn't know the Roku doesn't come with it lol.
"So disappointed we thought lets just pick-up the tv in store. Thought it might get damaged doing a delivery. Well it really didn't matter got home unpacked it. Setup the antena, plugeed it in. The screen is PIXILATED so bad 😞😔. Anyway RETURN process started. You can't WIN for LOSING ........."
Bought this tv on Black Friday 3 years ago maybe 4. It was marked down to 298$ but has remained at that price. TV works great. I lose my remote a lot so I just download the Roku app if the remote is hiding. It also links up with other Roku TV’s and you can switch tv remotes! Great sound great picture. If you want a big TV and not break the bank this is the TV for you. Inflation has not affected the price of this item!
I love this tv i went from a 42inch to 58in the quality is so good the sound is nice the sizing omg its so big i have to find a way to turn down the brightness i will say its a little bright but this is the best tv i gotten so far.. Im never picking another brand
"The very first day i got the tv home it was working perfectly; then all of a sudden, the speakers blew out, had to get a soundbar. And good luck trying to watch netflix, the reason I say that is after watching Netflix just for a couple of hours. the app crashed, and the app hasn't worked right since. now after a week of having the tv. It randomly froze up and the tv rebooted it self twice. And now the screen went really dark for no reason, that happened twice. Now i don't even bother using apps on this tv, cause the randomly freeze and crash. And yea I did update the firmware. And still hasn't done any good. I don't recommend this tv, unless you enjoy being irritated with it all the time."
"The well worn adage that  you get what you pay for couldn't be more true in this case.   As you can imagine most people buying a 4K TV this large for this money aren't exactly the most discriminating consumers, which explains all the glowing reviews.  

 If I could give this Hisense 58"" TV  ZERO STARS, I would.  Horrible backlight bleed on all four edges of the TV which is abundantly visible during viewing.  From what I can tell watching Youtube videos reviewing other Hisense TVs in the same price range, this is extremely typical.   Totally unacceptable unless you happen to be some hayseed who has bad vision and only watches broadcast TV.  Dolby Vision, ROKU,"
"If I could give negative stars I would. Believe the bad reviews. This tv is garbage. I purchased it March 2022 and as of June 2023, just over the year, it is garbage and Hisense said since I didn't purchase the extended warranty they are responsible for it. A tv is supposed to last more than a year. Hisense products are garbage do not purchase. Buy a tv from a reputable company. Lesson learned on my end. Never will a Hisense product ever come into my home."
Wish I could give it a zero!!!!! After having it maybe 1.5 years tops the power button started flashing and tv never did come back on!!! Looked on the internet for help tried everything for hours nothing worked!!   Guess you get what you pay for!!!!  Crap also bought one for my parents a year ago for a gift! I'm sure that will take a **** soon!
It went out on me after about 2 years. During the time it worked it had many issues including. It would darken itself to an unwatchable degree on any HDR videos on Amazon. There is no way to turn HDR off so this is just screwed. I couldn't watch multiple movies
Well it was good while it lasted you've been warned get a warranty warranty for at least 4 years I purchased mines 6/2019 it died Monday I know they don't makes things like they use to but this is terrible and whose boxing up a 58' TV to be repaired I have other Tv's older by other brands still going strong. Good Picture but from what I've seen on You tube a lot of people have had issues......So good luck you get what you pay for I guess???
"Picture and sound is good on this TV, easy to use but only a year and half old and gave out. Power red light is blinking and I’ve read online to unplug and reset the TV which I’ve done but no luck. Would recommend buying extended warranty as I’ve read in other reviews these TVs don’t last long. Not sure I’ll buy another if this is a continued problem with them"
"Good resolution color, good sound, great diversity of app, easy to use, good to use other devices with the tv, easy to connect to the internet, I add an antenna that work good.

I will like that in the future Hinsense tv add a browser, Facebook, Messenger and Twitter."
Had it for a month now. Great picture quality! Looks even better when calibrated.
Great size so far so good.
Perfect shipping. Excellent tv. Would purchase again
To me it seems like the volume is weak
Love this tv.  Roku is great - Used for my wife to watch workout videos.  perfect!
Love this Tv!! I got 2 of them one for me and a friend.
Easy install and great picture/sound
After just 3 months the whole picture went black
very happy with my tv. looks good
It was delivered and screen was broken. I do not have a car this will fit in to return and walmart is not picking up their phone.
"Can not really review, came with cracked screen and had obviously been sent back before,  no remote and not everything was in its package"
Nice tv. Picture is awsome. Came in good shape. I was worried but the make of the tv shouldn't worry you.
"The tv was a gift, my benefactor and I both liked the price.  It has been a great gift even though I don't watch much tv."
love this tv and have told my family they should get one while the store still has them in stock!!!!
"The tv is fine I don’t like that no one knocked , rung the doorbell with a 58” chillin on my porch and I didnt get a notification it was here :("
"This tv wasn’t mountable. The description should say this in the app. I’ve had to return two, this AND a TCL for the same reason."
It's a great TV. Two person job to mount on the wall. Don't recommend not wall mounting if you have children.
The only thing I dislike is that they deliver my tv and left outside anyone could of stole it but otherwise I love the tv
"The quality is great, good sound quality, my only problem is hooking a sound bar up to it doesn’t link very well but it doesnt need one really."
I LOVE this TV so far! I can not believe the price! AMAZING! Do not even hesitate to get this if you are looking!
"I have been very satisfied with this tv. Picture, sound and features are all very good and what I expected."
This is a great tv! Picture quality and sound are perfect. I cannot believe how inexpensive it was. I highly recommend it!
had this tv 3 months before the screen went black and manufacturer won't honor their warranty so im out a tv and the 300 dollars.  what a waste
"Very good Roku TV for the money. Plugged it in, connected the internet and started watching all kinds of TV programs."
"Everything is good, except for the sound.   It vibrates, going to ask for a replacement.   Otherwise couldn't be happier"
its an awesome tv but it does keep turning off and I am pretty disappointed on that. call the supplier and make sure you don't buy messed up tvs
So far so good. No problems with it. Obviously not a high end tv which is fine the resolution is good and I use it for gaming.
"Only thing I dont like about the tv is you have to turn the column way up to hear it. Other than that, it has a great picture and lots of features."
"Love this tv excellent choice, I had a Samsung and Vizio, i like the Roku and games that Hisense brings"
"Screen was cracked, returned for refund.  no more on display on store floor.  Now have to find another tv."
"Easy set up. Wonderful picture - clear, color great - just so happy with this purchase. Ordered it online and it arrived in good condition."
"Beautiful picture, Roku is so nice with many free movies and shows, the quality of this TV is top-notch.  I like it more than my Samsung."
"great price , wasnt able to connect with xfinity cable . but it had another option 
great screen. one remote does it all"
I purchased the tv in April of this year and 5 months later the television completely went out and will not come back on.
Good price and easy to set up. Unfortunately  every-time we turned the tv on the sound made a buzzing noise. We had to return it.
Tv is okay. Wouldn’t recommend buying. It shuts on and off randomly and I’ve only had it for 2.5 months and it won’t turn on today.
"I don't like having to use 2 remotes.
Everything else is good 
We have direct TV remote it won't sync up to Hisense TV."
"The Television has a crisp clear picture and is easy to program. The price was better than I expected. Delivery was quick, one day."
This TV's picture quality compares well to Samsung mu6290.  The Samsung is a little brighter but the Hisense picture quality is practically the same.
"Good picture and sound.  Great price!  
If you already have a Roku account this TV will be super easy to set up."
Stopped working. Its only been 1 year and half since purchasing. Was always turning off on its own also
"Really like the size , the picture is nice but it came with a small scratch on the left side of the screen its noticeable but barely"
"Television was damaged took it out of the box , installed the legs and plugged it up . Surprise screen damaged and no damage to the box"
First shipment was damaged by FeDEx. Walmart customer service sent replacement right away. Im in love
"This tv is GREAT and especially for the price. I bought it primarily for my grandson who loves a variety of shows that play on Netflix, YouTube"
I would live thus tv even more if there was a way to turn down the brightness a little more. this tv is very bright other wise it's awesome
noone from roku is ever available to speak to didnt know what roku was sending steam bar n some other thing back purchased elsewhere as well
Absolutely stunning !!! I love this tv !! It came in two days and was not damaged !!!! Before purchasing I did my homework and Im even more pleased
"My Roku smart TVwas delivered undamaged and on schedule!  Thank you Walmart,and FedEx for your outstanding, and professional service!"
The tv came with no connections made in the back. We had to take the back cover off and make all the connections. Was never put all the way together.
No airplay! But Android smarview works. App. control is less user friendly compared to Vizio. Other than that everything is good.
The tv arrived in excellent condition from fedex. Although it came 2 days late because of wildfires. The tv has great sound and video quality
"I'm very happy with the picture quality and ease of use with this tv for the price, you can't beat it!"
Don't hesitate because you think its not good quality because of the price. These are really good TVs.
"Probably the most bang for the buck you'll find. I tried a competitor's 58"" and returned it to get my second Hisense."
"bought it for 279 usd. Comparing it with TCL roku 55, it is way better with picture quality and sharpness"
Great TV and decent sound though i have ordered a surround sound anyway. Pleased with this purchase.
This has great lighting and sound. Has great speech for a person who is blind or visually impaired. I will buy again if need be.
"Excellent price for a 4K TV this size with great features, picture quality and sound. Almost did not need my soundbar."
I've been using roku smart tvs since 2015 and I really love it! This Hisense roku smart tv is a really good deal and the graphics is fantastic!
Received tv with broken screen! I opened it one month after receiving it to find it this way and now theres no returning!
"Super solid product, im about to move and its just the size i need and in the price range i need for the time."
"it is big and that's what I wanted.  I can see the players on the field from the kitchen, which is what I wanted!  Good sound, color, etc."
i have purchased this tv for every room in my house over the last year to replace old ones. i have 5 now and ive had no issues at all.
Had it for 8 months and there are 2 lines across the screen cheap so don’t plan on it lasting long. However easy to use Roku and apps.
"Very good picture quality, affordable price for its size, great sound quality (pretty loud), easy to setup."
The value for the size of TV. Also liked the way TV were listed along with good information on the product.
"came early with no damage, I'd read that some people were getting a damaged TV , great picture , just set it up with no problems yet."
Im amazed how beautiful pictures are on this television and I dont need a sound bar its amazing awesome great job
This is a great buy and we pleased with the quality and ease of use.  We highly recommend this Smart TV.
The TV arrived a day early and was well packaged.  Fast and easy set up.  We are so happy with this T.V.  Great quality and can't beat the price!
The screen will have a line down it after few months . No one has damaged my tv at all . Also the speakers vibrate and it’s not even loud
Screen went black in only 2 months. This is the 2nd Hisense TV to do this never again. Save your money and put it towards another brand
"I love it!!!! The picture is clearer than any other TV ive ever owned, even those that werw double the price!!!"
"Excellent picture quality.  Ease of setup.  If using a wall mount, make sure you have a good one.  This 58"" is heavy even if a flat screen."
it didn't turn on and sadly i got it on black Friday so now they are over a hundred bucks more. i want to cry waa
"We like everything about this TV, the sound and color are great.  This is our second Hisense product and have been pleased with both."
I paid to have it installed but it wasn't installed and I'm not sure if they charged me for the installation fee
I've had the TV for a week and so far it has been perfect.  Easy to set up and it has a great picture.  Can't beat it for the price.
"really good. it works great. nice and high quality image and the sound is really good, we didn't need to add a home theater"
"Amazing value.  I've been a big firestick supporter for years, but couldn't believe the ease of use and selection with Roku."
Love the size and picture. A great buy for the price paid. Not too happy about the sound quality. A bit low for my taste.
Great picture for the price.  Sound is decent as well. For $300 you really cannot go wrong with this one.
"Very happy with all all aspects of this TV, Great picture and sound. The Roku interface is very easy use."
"This TV has a great picture right out of the box !  Sound is good too.
Built in ROKU is a plus.
would recommend."
It worked for 30 minutes screen turned green than black and started to smell like burning electric. Do not buy.
"This Hisense TV has brilliant and crisp picture, the sound is as good as you get with this price range.  Higly recommended."
When the t.v arrived it was larger than I expected. After setting it up we was happy. The price is reasonable and affordable.
It is a great TV for a great price. I wish I could afford another one. Walmart is ALWAYS the best [lace to shop...
This Hisense TV has very good quality and shows a beautiful picture at a great price. I highly recommend!
Not very sturdy frame and arrived damaged. A friend later had the same experience. Both had to be returned.
"I have had the TV for some time now and I'm very happy with the purchase..
IV had no trouble with it and I will highly recommend it to any one else.."
Exceptional tv for the price. I know that it is a world brand that does not market much in the States. Definitely buy this tv!!!
I have 2 of these TV's. Great bang for the buck. Never had an issue with either one. Easy to set up.
Damage screen No Damage to box  box was okay TV damaged very disapointed !!!!!! after waiting for arrial how is boz okay and TV damaged !!!
"Very easy to put together, was unsure of this brand but color is wonderful and the sound quality isn’t terrible. Worth it for the price and size."
Excellent tv for picture and features.  Very light and need care when picking up not to squeeze corners of screen too tight.
This TV is better than I expected. I Have no complaints or regrets in this purchase. It's definitely worth the price!
I had a Hisense before so I knew the quality too expect and was not disappointed. Very well worth the money.
Love the price. We can't believe how clear the picture is. The sound is great didn't have to buy a sound bar. We are very please!
I  purchased this tv in January  it blew out today I'm  so disappointed I have old tv's 8 years old that still work!
"Easy to use, high quality picture. Very large so had someone help me install.  Roku software is very easy for my parents to use, overall happy, 5 stars."
"Get the TV in February of 2022. March 27, 2023 I was watching a movie and the screen went black. Everyone is telling the truth about the tv going out only after a short period. I wasted money and my son is out of a tv that he barely used."
"My sis got me this TV for my house last year when i purchase my home. i don't know if it  the software because everytime i use Netflix, Prime, YouTube...it keep kicking out to home."
My son help me find this television for my parents. They’re in their 80s and 90s but enjoy their TV. It is a great size for them and they love the clear picture and great sound.
Just bought this tv and it was broken soon as I turned it on. I am very disappointed with whoever manufactures for Walmart. I will be making calls in the morning and going to the store  because this is ridiculous.
Amazing budget TV that gave my room a look of a theatre. Satisfied with the picture and sound quality. The big screen in this price range is what gives this TV an edge over others.
Show a clear picture. I’m very satisfied with my purchase. I never had a bad experience with anything I have ever purchased at this merchant. The 58” inch is awesome it’s was worth buying for the price I payed i’m pleased.. Thank you.
We recently purchased this tv and are so far enjoying it. It's ROKU so that's a big plus. Does seem to have a few glitches but we hope it will adjust to the Roku apps.
I bought this tv just a little over a year ago and lines started coming across the screen and then it went blank. Their is no way a tv should last 14 months hopefully they can fix the issue
"Crystal Clear Picture!!  Upgrades picture quickly to HDR when it's  streamed in 4k.  I'm  using a 4K Roku Ultra hooked up to a Sony surround sound system, not the built-in Roku."
I purchased this in store and it randomly freezes up won't do anything and then restarts itself it's getting really annoying and I don't know who to reach out to since it's been just over a month that I've had the tv.
"I have one year and 3 months and the TV is not working, first time this happens to me in a Tv, talked to Hisense Company and they only warranty is a year."
"Don't waste your money. I purchased this tv and everything was good. Fast forward a year and the tv wont show a picture, just a blank screen. Tried calling customer support to no avail. So I end up purchasing a 55"" TCL. Very disappointed in Hisense."
It's an easy set up and it's a good quality for the price. Just used to play my PS5 and fire stick so I didn't need many features. Plays loud and the picture is good.
"I've had this TV now for 2 years and I've always had problems. The apps close on their own, the memory fills up and the sound is not very good. I have to constantly unplug my TV to get it to even kinda work."
Hisense is not honoring their advertized Warranty!  It's a rip-off! Only lasted 6 months will no longer power up!  Hisense claims they have no tech in my area so they want an additional $100 to fix it plus I pay all shipping!  %23FUBAR !!!
"I bought this TV a month ago because it was very cheap and I needed a TV and I didn't want to spend much. I am very happy with this Roku TV, the volume is amazing, the hd image is very neat and the control remote is easy to use."
"The TV so far is awesome. I love all the free movies, music and live tv. The picture is unbelievable. I'm getting rid of my direct TV because of this TV."
Purchased TV from Walmart and they would not take the TV back nor replace the TV for it had a smashed screen. Still had the receipt but still they would not accept to replace the TV!
"This tv is amazing! I'm surprised that it didnt cost much more than it did. But, then again, Walmart's prices... Great!"
"DO NOT GET THIS TV. I have only had this tv 2 years and now the screen is black and won't work. Sound comes on, picture won't. Waste of money."
"Beautiful TV at an unbelievably low price.  It's just what my bedroom needed, and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again."
"I bought this TV in January 2022, worked great until now, May 2023, and the screen went out already! Piece of garbage don't waste your money!"
"love it, great pic and sound... I ordered it on line then picked it up after work the same day...
for a 58inch with Roku built in good picture and great built in sound for under 300 you won't be disappointed with this television"
"For $300 this TV exceeded my expectations, it has a great picture and sound and the Roku integration is seamless and not laggy at all. Can’t complain at all. Now let’s hope it doesn’t break in a few months."
"Picture freeze. Over and Over and Over and Over. Regardless of channel. Very Disappointed! I have unplugged, hard reset and it still freezes. We loved it until this."
"The TV is working great I purchased it for my parents they love it especially the ROKU benefits to it. Good TV for the price we purchased it for. Took a long time to receive from Walmart but other than I give it a 5 stars,"
I bought this tv this past December and I haven’t any problems with it as of today. I love it better than my Vizio and Samsung tv! Better picture and sound also!
"This product arrived damage. There were lines on the screen similar to water mark on glass, no picture at all. I had to disassembly and bring back to the store.  You guys may want to change the carrier that you use for delivery."
"A good value at sub-$300 for a 58 inch 4K television, however we are somewhat reluctant to say such in that we are replacing a malfunctioning 13 month old, 55 inch, TCL 4K television which we also thought was a good value until it malfunctioned."
"The1y didn't even ring the doorbell or knock on the door. My neighbor knocked on the door and showed me the tv, he said he was afraid it would get stolen if left outside. I never knew it was there."
"BUYER BEWARE TGIS IS 57.5 INCHES DIAGONAL.. IT IS 50"" ACROSS, NOT A TRUE 58"" TV, while its an ok tv it is not 58"" it is 50 and when u try to talk to them about it they say to read the box.. it is 57.5 inches measured DIAGONAL what the actual?"
Cracked screen. Also the box looked old. Looks like they shipped and old cracked tv to me. Reordering again. Hopefully this time they send me a brand new 2020 Hisense 58R6E3. Else I would stop buying from walmart.
"i bought this tv over 5 years ago for 348.00 total.  It got watched ALOT.  Today it would not turn on, so I am looking to replace with the same size Hisense.  made it perfectly through 2 moves also!! Tvs are like anyhing else, tgey wear out."
It’s so convenient to have a store. That stocks a great TV. I’ll ask who years I think about eight of them. They’re in every room. It’s nice to have options. Thanks Walmart.
"My third Hisense. I love them. I will only use/buy a Roku tv because I really dislike the other “smart tv’s.” Great picture,  definitely loud enough, easy to use, and maybe the least expensive brand out there."
We got our 58' Hisense Roku tv for a really great price. We had a 55' TCL Roku tv before but our son broke it. We were really satisfied with the previous tv so we decided to stay with the Roku brand.. you can't beat the quality for the price.
Great picture. Easy to use. I love this tv got it for a discount deal. I’m used to using the Roku plugins and this is my first Roku tv…I am not disappointed. Highly recommend!!
"The picture is very clear, the sound is good. We replaced a 60” with this 58”. We don't notice a difference in the slightly smaller size. It's our first Smart TV; we're enjoying all the new channels."
"Loved the tv but 9 months in it went out. Black screen of death. Tried all the resets we could find and nothing worked. Great! Just what we needed 2 days before Christmas, our only tv going out."
"Did not last at least 3yrs. Called technical support and they would not help. I have other name brand TV's at least 5yrs old, and they all still work. I will never buy Hisense anything"
They took money out my account for items they did not have in the store and are telling me I have to wait 5 to 10 business days to get my money back. Basically they stole from me taking my money for merchandise that they did not have!!!!!
If you want to have your tv working for more than 2 years don’t purchase this item! I’m shy of 3 years and the screen went out  out of nowhere!! I’ll never  purchase this brand again!
"loved this tv for a several months.  after 11 months of use, the screen had black and white lines on it, like a broken cell phone screen.  Called Hisense support and they replaced the boards.  Now a few days later, its happened again."
"A better picture than my more costly present tv, better sound quality, built in free channels I am paying over a hundred a month for now so go big heck its practically free."
dont buy this tv i bought it a year ago and it no longer works and walmart did not offer a protection plan when i bought it so i wasted 400 dollars . buyer be ware
"DO NOT BUY GET A DIFFERENT TV bought the 75"" lasted literally the month of warranty end 1y and the back light went out they well not replace and read that this had happened to all sizes"
Only lasted me 3 years I bought this television on 2019 Christmas and yesterday while watching baseball World Series the screen went black. I tried to reset unplug but screen still black!
I gave simple instructions they didn’t follow no one came to my house with the tv because I was home all day I wrote delivery instructions not followed at all
I chose a delivery time for when i would be home! Why would you leave a $300 tv on the porch for someone to steal!!! I was not home!!! That is why i pcked a delivery time frame!
Don't believe the good reviews for Hisense. They are bottom of the barrel quality. Had mine for about two years and it is dead. It is a throw away TV not worth buying
"The Hisense 58"" has a beautiful picture and is ready to go! Easy set up and very easy to navigate through the apps. I LOVE having access on the TV to ROKU, my cable channels, Live TV and so much more!"
Tv only lasted 2 years and stopped working all of a sudden it will not turn on even after resetting it multiple times don’t waste your money on buying one every 2 years
"Bought this tv after almost a year of having it, it’s acting up already never messed it up nothing it just randomly started acting dumb and flickering I don’t recommend getting this tv at all buy a better brand don’t buy Hisense TVs"
"I purchased this tv a year ago, and   the screen just went out! it I don't recommend it  when the tv worked. its pictures  quality was great. it costs too much to fix."
"So far I have had this tv for 1 week still learning how everything goes
But the picture is great &clear
The only little disapointment I
wish i would have bought the 55 inch  But I am happy with the quality"
What I like is the price.   What we did not like at first was the picture was not as clear as our broken Samsung but we did find the proper adjustments and it’s all good now
Have only had TV 9 months and it went off on it’s own and won’t turn back on.  I understand that you get what you pay for but you should pay a little more and get a TV that works longer
It's a great TV for the money! How can you beat a 58 inch 4K TV for $300? The answer is you can't. Great value and the picture is very good for the casual viewer and gamer.
"Bought it in March 2020…..worked fine until a couple days ago,when it started going haywire,tried to reset it and wouldn’t respond to remote at all….tried to get in touch with customer support….complete waste of time…guess you get what you pay for"
Great picture quality with this tv. Vivid and vibrant. Very easy to set up. Remote is very small and simple to operate. Many nice features for a nice price.
"So far so Good i really like the Roku style i have had this Brand/Model in the android version and it quit in exactly 2 years, so for that only time will tell"
"We love these TVs! We purchased one for each of our rentals, and everyone seems to love the big screen! Never had an issue and our rentals are short term so we are always there making sure everything is on working order."
"This TV has great color, much better sound quality than I was expecting, and the price was awesome. I got it around thanksgiving time last year and have had zero problems with it.  Highly recommend!"
I was apprehensive about buying a brand I was not familiar with. The price initially attracted me. Setup was easy. The picture quality is very good. I have used for almost 2 months with no issue at all. I recommend!
TV was TRASH! After 1 year of having it the screen went black. They refused to fix it because it was 1 month over the year warranty. I would never purchase this bar and EVER again! I guess you get what you pay for on Black Friday!!
got this tv with my granddaughter's help and the promise to help me get started the right way and you are older and not computer savvy it would be wise to take a younger person with you
"Great price for the size i bought, great picture quality, surround sound is awesome and it is easy to navigate and personalize apps and streaming channels"
I love this Hisense TV.  This TV has a beautiful picture and is very easy to navigate around the menus and roku app.  This has definitely been my favorite television that I have bought and a great value!
"Like many other reviews stated, the screen goes black after a while. I've had this TV for 14 months with no issues. All of a sudden, the screen goes black. I can still hear sound but no picture. Hisense will not replace/repair because I did not purchase an extended warranty and I'm two months out of the 1-year warranty. I really wish I did but have had all my TV's for 7  years and multiple moves with no issues so I didn't think I'd ever need to pay for an extended warranty. My mistake! I bought two Hisense TV's (58” and 65”) after selling all my belongings and moving across the country. Another mistake - not researching Hisense beforehand. Apparently this black screen is very common and has been an issue for years. I completely regret these purchases and wish I would not have made the quick decision to buy these based on the cheaper price. I mean cheap is cheap for a reason but again, I've had two other cheap TV's that are still working today after now 9 years! Hisense is very much aware of the black screen issue but keeps making them with no improvement. What a crappy way to run a business. I see the trend is for the TV to stop working just after the 1-year warranty as Hisense knows many people don't buy the extended warranty. Even when speaking to their customer service, I asked the representative if this was such a common issue, why won't Hisense just fix the problem when making new TV's?? Or at least offer a longer free warranty? All she could say was they could only assist if it was within the 1-year warranty and completely disregarded my questions. I don't blame her though as the calls are recorded and her job is to read the scripted answers. Anyways, learn from my mistakes and do your research!! In my opinion, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM HISENSE! 
And Hisense - don't even bother responding with your ridiculous blanket statement of how much you take pride in your high-quality products. Just make better, long lasting products. That's how you show you care and can back up your “high quality” products."
"This television is nice. However, I only had the television for 2 years and the screen is dark, and it turns off and doesn't turn back on. I felt confident knowing I had All State protection to find out that the insurance only covers certain things. This was not explained to me. Nevertheless, I will not buy another protection plan."
"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. I'm saving your frustration and anxiety!  What a piece of crap. Always slow and delayed response. Reminds you of slow computers that respond to your command 15 to 20 seconds later and if you click more than once, they FREEZE UP.  I have had it less than two weeks and I hate it. I wish I would not have thrown the packaging away.  

The Roku aspect is annoying also. You can just start the tv and it shows last channel you were on. It starts on Home Screen and you have to select tv, or app first.  Just overall hugely disappointing."
worst tv ive ever owned. after a week ive experienced problems with disconnecting from the internet constantly. no other devices have problems in the house. i do a connection test and it says internet signal excellent. still doesn't connect unless i unplug the tv and plug back in. afterwards it takes about an hour and it does it all over again. do not biy this brand
"I have had this TV for about 2 1/2 years. I’ve always had problems. Like screen turning black or it would not turn on or just turn off. It always still worked so I never bothered to do anything about it. Well until it didn’t. It turns on and all you see is the logo then it turns off then on again. I called customer support. Ha! their support is a joke! Told me to press the reset button. Did nothing. So it needs to be serviced. But… only a year warranty sooo basically call someone else and figure it out. I have a zenith,Panasonic ,tcl and insignia. The zenith and Panasonic I’ve had for 11 plus years and not one problem! The other two I’ve had about 4 years. No problems. Hisense 2 1/2 years and it’s now a giant paperweight that I have to dispose of. Yeah that brand may be cheaper. But cheaper is not cheaper when you have to replace it every couple years! Plus pay to dispose of it! Spend the extra! You will thank me later 😁"
This is an impressive TV with 4k capabilities. I use this for gaming and it goes well with Xbox series x or any other system. I give 5 stars probably best TV I've had not to mention the price was lower than expected. All in all a very nice upgrade for 4k or any movie watcher. Nice TV for the price
"I loved the TV while it actually worked. But i have only had it for 10 months and it has already went completely out. A few days ago it started glitching but I thought maybe it was the internet, then in the midst of watching everything went black and it hasn't worked since. I am very disappointed. I would have given it 5 stars and I am only giving it 1 now because it didn't even last a year."
""
"I have fell in love with Hisense Smart TVS . They are very affordable , and the picture show , very pretty . And I love the build in Roku App . And if you are looking for a good price tv , Hisense is the way to go . I have 32 , 40 , 55 , 58 , 70 inches in each of mine rooms in my home . I have went Hisense crazy."
I was very excited to upgrade to such a large screen. i loved it. but at about 5 and a half months a dead pixel line appeared across the screen and now the bottom fifth of the screen blinks with weird discoloration. i fully recommend buying any other tv.

"TV was right price and delivered on date as stated on line. I had concern about truck delivery, although the box was ruffed up tv is fine and works perfectly. Had difficulty finding our “ air” channels but finally found out how to manage channels and success!!!"
Excellent I love it
"I am really let down. I was hoping my TV would last more than 1 year and 5 months. my screen all of a sudden is not near as bright as it was and when screen loads and is dark i see flashes. tried everything to correct it evrrything from settings, to reset, to unplug and nothing corrected it."
"What started out as a good Roku Ready Flatscreen, came to a screeching Halt today (and not 30 days past Warranty Expiration!), personally I wouldn't buy another Hisense Product at this point. Every TV, Digital or not, have always lived no less than 10 years in our Home! From Sony, to Vizio, to Samsung, and others...
I liked the Roku Ready part because living in wide open Country, I can't rely on Wi-Fi,  but I can Mirror my Phone using the App I need!
BUT, one year just doesn't cut the mustard!
So I don't Recommend this TV!"
"58' TV is just the perfect spot between a 55"" and 65"" tv. Picture is amazingly clear and colors are vibrant. This brand may not be well know by its name , but is made by Toshiba and rock solid.

TV SETUP is super easy, especially with Roku as the operating system. It walks you through all of the tv prompts, and recognizes what you have plug into it. Took literately 5 minutes. If you are cutting the cable line and going streaming, this is the way to go - RoKu makes it so easy. 

Want to add a SOUNDBAR? The Soundbar must be Roku compatible, regardless if it has a HDMI ARC connectors. 

What doesn't work: 
First I got a LG Sound bar and subwoofer - it only worked using the basic digit audio cable. Would not work using the HDMI ARC connections (which gives superior audio, allows the ROKU tv remote to control the volume and add in specific audio controls on the Roku tv) - took me 2 hours calling LG, Hinense and ROKU to finally figure it out. So frustrating - boxed it up and took in back to Walmart. 

What Does work:
Bought a onn. 3.1 Atmos Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer, 37"" - which is ROKU compatible. Super easy to get out of the box and set up within 5 minutes. Plug the HDMI Arc connections (TV and sound bar, plug the power lines in - sound bar and sub) and then turn on the TV. It automatically reconginzes the soundbar and does the setup for you. Best sounding Soundbar I have ever owned, compared to a TCL, Samsung or LG. Save yourself a lot of headaches and get a matching compatabile RoKu system. 

Wish people were more knowledgeable on what is compatabile. My advice, regardless of what TV you by - get a matching soundbar to reduce your stress when setting it up."
"Excellent price. Free delivery. The 56” TV arrived at my front door just hours after my purchase. 
A photo was taken and notification given to me. Prompt service with excellent real time communication through the Walmart network. I had the choice to pick up in person or in the store also. I am very pleased."
"bought my 58 in back in the end of 2019 at walmart and within just 1 year (2020) of having the tv, the screen went black but the power button would still be lit red. tried multiple troubleshooting methods and decided to call hisense to get it replaced or at least have one of their technicians come out. overall, they couldn’t help because the tv is only under warranty for 1 year and told me that they will not send out a technician, even if i wanted to pay for the repair but they rejected and told me to find a technician near me. any tv technician that i’ve called, gave me their honest opinion about hisense and said that it’ll be cheaper just buy another tv but from a different brand because it’s a common thing that these tvs from hisense don’t last. this company knows that they sell products that do not last and don’t even at least offer an extended warranty or to at least offer to fix it even if i’m willing to pay extra. over $300 for a tv that didn’t last in under 2 years. ridiculous."
After removing the TV from the box and mounting on the wall I turned it on just to see the screen was cracked. It looked as if it was hit with a hammer near the middle at the top. I've returned it and already ordered another one. I'll change my rating if the second one is in better condition.
Loved it
"The power went out at my house, and then the TV never came back on. It appears that the backlight went out in the TV. I have a power surge on my house, but the TV was still damaged. I have to buy any TV which sucks. Hopefully, the power company will reimburse me. Up until this point I really liked the TV, but I won’t buy another one."
"I like the TV, it work well. Here's the problem. My son hook his xbox to it. After 2 to 5 weeks of playing several hours a day, lines started appearing when I would watch TV. Then a week later the screen start showing black. It had not been a year yet. Very disappointed!"
"Its about what you would expect for the price so im ok with it. I didnt like the audio at first it has to be cranked up so high. I bought nice wireless speakers to help it along only to realize the set does not possess Bluetooth capability, which i shouldve checked that before i bought it. But picture is big, vivid, so im ok with it"

"I had a very expensive Samsung tv prior to this one, that lost the picture. I wasn’t sure I’d like this brand tv, but I have used Roku for years now so I felt like I’d give it a try. Picture is great, and so simple to set up! I am so happy I took the chance on this tv brand!!"
I loved this TV for  the less than 2 yrs I’ve had it but turned it on day before yesterday and the picture is dim and getting dimmer.  I have reset and rebooted and still getting dim.  It also got in a reboot loop and had to unplug for about 30 mins. It only occasionally reboots now.
"Walmart is a joke, they delivered to wrong address and then when I got it it was an open box, no power cord no remote ,no stand or instructions.
now I have to wait a week to get a replacement. its a good deal so i will wait but what a joke, and then you get the joy of speaking to someone where english is not first language, bless them I know they have families too and is not thier fault."
This TV is great
"So the TV itself is a nice size , quality great ! Butttttttttt. I received notification that item was on the way as scheduled, received text that said delivered however I had not received it . The tracking still said out for delivery so I made contact with was supposedly the driver and it's insta delivery whom advised my purchase was returned to the store but could not advise which one or why. Contact Walmart CS where advise still out as what it showed and I had until 8pm to receive. 7:59 pm no TV call Walmart CS back because app still showing out for delivery only to be told it was returned to store and advised which one. Called store and an associate by the name of Sean was extremely helpful as I was FRUSTRATED!!! Because I never rcvd a call to update me on what happened, Sean said because it didn't fit in drivers car they never took possession. Now I'm confused because why send a text saying it was delivered if never left with it. And no wonder the reviews shows items being delivered damaged because they are using insta delivery to delivery items just like your grocery had I known I would have went into store. But I was able to retrieve my purchase at 9:00 pm at night after waiting all day . Walmart please get a better system because insta delivery for electronics is not it!!"
"Horrible to be honest. Got the TV and won’t connect to internet, gets to “looking for software update” and then screen goes blank. Really upset with this purchase. Would be a great tv if the set up wasn’t so difficult. It’s not my wifi, I ran tests and restarted wifi about 5 times and still nothing. Red button also flashing on the bottom of my tv, which I looked up and it states it’s an issue with the TV."
"This is the worst tv I have ever purchased in my life. I think the manufacturer willfully built it to last a couple years then it dies on you. Mine lasted only 2 years and now dead as a door knob. Caveat: stay away from this crap of a brand, HISENSE!"
DO NOT BUY THIS TV.  We bought 2 and brought them home.  Set one up in our living room on our first floor and set up the second one in the master bedroom on the second floor far away.  The remotes change both tv's and then cause them to freeze and lock up so that no one can watch tv.  It is the worst technology ever and there is no solution.  DO NOT BUY!
"DON'T BUY THIS TV. I bought this TV 01/19/21. It won't power on completely. It has a black screen. I spoke with Hisense, they told me it is out of warranty and they can't help me. I have 3 Hisense TV's and I won't buy another one. Their customer service is horrible."
"vertical lines on tv first time turned on,  troubleshooting has not resolved!"
very unhappy!! Damaged!! whole screen was cracked!!!
good price for the size. quality of the picture is ok. could use a better remote
Had two of these shipped. Both arrived with the screen imploded. Very flimsy design.
Weird tv. Some of the newer shows on netflix wont play on it. I'm going to send it back.
It only lasted two years. I really liked it up until then.
This TV was  great for the price......light weight and easy to set up
"This is my 3 TV on this brand , I am very satisfied. I do recommend.."
Great quality for the price!
A Great deal for the size television and its a smart tv no cable necessary to use
"can not download apps
no internet browser
picture quality is good"
Better quality than expected for the price.
Was a gift and he loves it!!
Great TV for the affordable price!
"What a surprize.  Did not expect the quality and the size of a great 58"" TV.  Streaming is easy."
Great picture.  Bright colors.
Great picture easy setup and perfect price
Best TV I have ever bought!!
I have problems with my volume button
Luv the picture sound n everything about my new tv
Beautiful TV.  The picture is clear and the sound is excellent.  I'd buy it again.
buyer beware TV stopped working after 18 months manufacturer does not cover over 12 months
Love my TV. It was a great value.
Its a great tv all you need in one remote.
This tv is not a flat back so it has been hard to find the correct wall mount.
Love the set up and price . Replaced a samsung that only lasted 2yrs.
"I ordered the ps5 for my fiancés birthday. It took less than 24 hours to receive it, which was amazing ! While being delivered the driver texted me giving me notice she was going to drop it off. That was also really nice seeing as it’s a large purchase. He loves his ps5, Thanks!"
"I purchased this PS5 as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it! The only ""issue"" I experienced with this order was delayed shipping. Delivery was expected to take one week, and ended up taking 9 days. I wasn't notified of any delays until the morning of the initial delivery date. It wasn't too big of deal, considering we can not find any PS5s locally. He got it. He's happy. I'll take it."
"Alright. So like some people here it gave me a really long shipping date, but I got it 10 days after I bought it on the Walmart website. I got the bundle at retail price it was not jacked up for me. I was losing hope I'd ever get one. Here we are though got one on my desk :)"
great value i buy directly from Wal-Mart  for $559.00 and is legit 💯 fast shipping the only Disappointment was for FedEx that live the package in front of the Door luckily my neighbor are great decent moral people al saves the package for me. other wise if someone sees may take the package 👎for FedEx.  👍🏼for Wal-Mart.
absolutely love the PS5 and I really love this God of war bundle it is really worth the price if you are deciding on buying it trust me you will not go wrong I really love it much better than the other PlayStation's I really love the new design of the controller have fun hours playing it
"Like, fast shipping, everything was as advertised, availability. The system is awesome, loading time are fast, you can switch between games and you can transfer everything from PS4.

Dislike,mailman left package in a unsafe area, no deliveries options like pick up at store or at post office."
"Great gaming system! love the design and the interface which took me a few days to get used to. Im a Playstation fan that owns two Xbox X and the digital version. both systems are great in their own way, but I realy love the graphics and and sound quality coming from the Playstation 5 better. and the  exclusive games that sony brings out.

Playstation 5 is worth the money! Buy!"
"Thank you thank you thank you! 
This grandma is so happy , excited to receive this ps5 from 'Santa' for her grandson. 
Thank you so much, the affordable price and great shipping and packaging!"
I read some review that scared me but we got our PlayStation in less than a week and shipping box as well as play station box we’re in great condition.
The whole process was a 10/10. Even though my package was delayed I was always updated and notified. I purchased the PS5 so I was a bit worried since there was no option to require a signature. On the day of delivery they did knock and request a signature. So that was a plus. My box came in perfect condition and everything works perfectly.
"Hey y’all, so I have been waiting to get a ps5 since it came out. After not being able to find any in store I decided to try and order one this holiday season (2022) I saw they were available for purchase and ordered one on thanksgiving day. I used 3rd party financing (affirm)"
"Great price and great product it came on time and it is the disk version as well for $559, Thank you my son is going to be very happy for Christmas!"
"I would have given 5 stars but this was an opened package that was supposed to be brand new, arrived late, and the charging cord for the controller was missing. Been waiting forever to get one of these so unfortunately I have to just accept it because if I return it I won’t get another one most likely."
"never thought i would get a PS5, really glad i did, it was a surprise birthday present from my wife. honestly the best as far as major consoles go. ive had an Xbox series S. even though its a little more than twice the size of my series S, better, i can honestly say the PS5 has better game quality. picture, graphics and performance. God of War Ragnarok is insane. story rich and incredible combat mechanics. great to have the blades of chaos back. all in all, i strongly recommend it. one thing that caught me by surprise was the voice commands. after enabling just say ""hey playstation"" and get a short cut to anything. even to put the PS5 to sleep."
"This console is fantastic the one sent to me works wonders and nothing is wiring with it it runs perfect it plays disk games without any issues. The only thing I dislike is that even though your getting the God Of War Ragnarok bundle with the digital code for the game the control is just the standard one not the limited edition one, It’s a slight annoyance but all around 10/10"
I had no issues what so ever! My PS5 arrived two days ahead of schedule! They delivered it  to my house in a  separate box. That did not reveal that it was a PlayStation! I am super excited that it came with a digital game card! It’s located inside the Ps5 box at the bottom when you remove your console! They could have put it at the very top where the controller was located! Overall I’m happy.
"The PS5 arrived in exactly a week and so far it’s been awesome, I already have like 10 games. The only funny thing is how even tho you buy the disc version you still get a digital download paper of GOWR instead of disc, and it’s at the bottom and easy to overlook so don’t lose it! 10 out of 10!"
"Ordered the PS5 and received it next day to my door. Wasn't home at the time but my landlord was, thankfully. Delivery person missed my instructions to deliver it to landlord specifically in fears it would be stolen. Unfortunately he didn't care and couldn't be bothered, but fortunately, alls well than ends well. You could imagine the excitement on both my father and brother's face that Christmas morning. To this day, it was the best purchase I made for a family member. They get great use out of it and haven't had any issues with it. Great bundle deal. My brother really enjoys the Ragnorok game (if I even spelled that right.) All in all, walmarts delivery employees could care more, but overall, great purchase."
System is solid. Graphics are just ok. Some cool new added features like the microphone in the controller. Really nothing special.  Love the Walmart price of only $509 with God of War bundle. It came 2 days early. Thanks Walmart.
I got this Console over a month ago and it has been great. The only problem I have with the PS5 is the short memory storage issue. Other than that I can't say anything negative about the console 💯👍🏾
"This is a great product I love the Nintendo switch I am not and it's in a fanboy I play all consoles and games this is a must have if you are a true gamer




It's everything I expected I know a lot of people saying that the system. Scratches the switch console and it freezes and also have the dead pixels none of those are an issue with my switch"
What I like about Nintendo Switch is that the games are challenging and fun because I can feel the excitement and amount of adrenaline
Love it. Been trying for months to get one. This thing is beast compared to my Switch Lite. Love the bigger screen and the docobility option. The joycons are even nicer in person.
We verified our product was original Nintendo product from serial code. It came very quick and we are happy with the purchase ( store - 6AVE eletronics )
I love my new switch. The only thing I wasnt too thrilled about were these scratch mark looking things on the switch screen when I opened my order an the box was pretty scratched up too but not getting too upset about it I was just more like oh what the. What happened here XD.  Cuz I did have this mailed to me an maybe it got a little messed up during shipment but they should be more careful especially with electronics. Things happen   and Besides Im mostly playing this on my big screen an not really gonna be using switch screen so other than that. Im in love!!!!
"When I received the Switch box was unsealed and it was a EUR version. It was apparent upon unpackaging that the box had been opened previously, as a US adapter had been added to the end of the EU plug, and both adapter and plug were worn. The Switch unit itself was scratch/mark free and appears to work just fine, as do all other accessories, but if you are going to sell EU versions why not put it in the item description? And why is the adapter the only complaint I have?"
This was not as described. It was a Japanese version. All materials were in Japanese and the plug was Japanese. It couldn't even be plugged in here in the US.
It was broken when it arrived have had it charging for 3 hours now still will not power up at all screen has scratches in it looks refurbished supposed to be new very disappointed as it was a gift for my daughter..pretty devastated as a dad who promised his baby girl this...now the company I guess Wal-Mart went through to get this is making it difficult to return
"I bought this and received it horrible condition. Im not quite sure why they would send an item like this in a plastic shipping bag. It would have been sent in a box with bubble wrap.
I plan to gift this and feel as though I cant!"
"I bought this for my daughter, Two days later it  stopped charging. You would think for the amount of money it costs It would of had a better battery!!!"
"Order this item online for Christmas! Did not work! With this being a major gaming company I never thought to check it before wrapping and placing under the tree! I would have thought they would do test before sending such items out! Went to return to Walmart, they would not return since it had been more that 30 days, (I thought they gave 90). Was told to call Walmart customer service number! Will post update once this has been resolved!"
Item is clearly used and I paid full price. NOT for a refurbished item.
"This console is great!! Works perfectly, came in early, no scratches! Very impressed highly recommend!!!"
Pretty awesome little gaming console.
Item came as expected. It was timely and in new condition.
Brand new. Arrived very well packaged. Arrived a full week before it was scheduled to!!
"I bought this switch in August honestly I hardly play it but when I do play it I play for 3 to 4 days straight. Well I started noticing about 2 days ago the buttons started getting stuck or I had to push A 3 time for it to ok the game to start. Today is December 25th and my switch will not turn on. I was playing a game and decided to put another game on. I closed out the game I was playing put the console on sleep mode, I put in a new game and now it doesn't turn on. I put it on the charger and nothing. I'm pushing the on/off button and still nothing. My switch won't turn on. I let it sit on the charger for an hour and still nothing. $390 dollars down the drain.."
"Easy transaction with quick shipping! I love my Switch! Try using online service,  lots of free Nintendo and NES games you can play."
Nintendo Switch is just what I thought it would be! Straight entertainment out of the box. System was easy to set up and my daughters were able to be playing within 15 minutes. Directions were easy to follow and controls are similar to previous Nintendo systems.  I love that you can play on the go as well as at home on the TV.
"Got this as a bundle with a free game (choose from 3 available), plus an extra accessory (choose from 2). Great value for the money ($329).

Pretty easy set up to the TV, and really small, barely larger than some phones, so it's footprint is tiny in the entertainment center. I was actually able to hide it behind a DVD box set and a box for a small fan (it's a Xmas gift, pic below). Tried it out, set up the parental controls, and it's ready to go. The graphics are SWEET."
I have owned and loved every PlayStation since the PS1. I ordered this on February 17 2023 with a copy of the Dead Space remake and I absolutely love it. It comes with a game called Astro's Playroom pre-installed which is great because it shows you all the stuuf the DualSense 5 controller can do. It's also just a fun game to play to pass the time. You could easily spend a couple of hours at a time playing Astro's Playroom. I highly recommend buying the PS5 disc edition.
"After waiting years of it being out of stock I finally got mine with my Tax return. The console itself is large but yet its light, threw me off but it works so well as I expected. I have being playing playstion snice PS1 so this was definitely a great buy and I al ready to see what games are coming in the future!!!!!"
"Im so happy with my ps5. After the release of Hogwarts Legacy, I just couldn’t wait any longer to get my ps5. I was able to get one shipped and sold by Walmart directly while they were in stock for $499. I paired my purchase with a starlight blue cover and matching controller. I couldn’t be happier, especially because the scalpers didn’t get my money. The ps5 itself is in perfect condition. Box undamaged and unopened. Extremely happy to finally got my hands on one."
"The PS5 is awesome! I have had a ps4 for over 4 years and it was time to upgrade. And we’ll it’s totally worth it. Graphics are amazing, the speed on the console is crazy!"
Delivery was quick and easy!got it earlier then the actual delivery date!
Finally after 2 years I was able to catch a restock
"love, love, love, love, love! IM SOOO HAPPY ITS INSANE"
Perfect gift for my son and excellent price
upgrading from ps4 to ps5 has been exactly what i needed. my ps4 was becoming so slow and laggy that it was impossible to enjoy certain video games.
"The box that Walmart ships the PS5 in is absolutely asinine. It has 2 decent size cutouts over the barcodes, which are literal holes in the shipping box itself. These holes expose nearby wording which identify the contents as a PlayStation. Luckily, mine was not stolen, but I was also home to receive it. 

Furthermore, either my courier thought the holes made great handles or the holes allowed the package to become snagged on something. Either way, not only was the shipping box torn open, but this also completely ripped up the bottom of the PS5 packaging.

I've never made a stink before, no matter how poor the packaging. However, when I spend $550 on a single item, I expect it to arrive protected....or, at the very least, in a box with all ..."
This is my first gaming system and i have been having so much fun on it! Easy set up and minimal supervision required lol!
Ps5 is beautiful great features and hubby loved it
"Took 2 years, I was trying to find something else when I saw a guy with a PS5, I ran to the video game area and saw this magnificent piece of work, thank you god."
"Well I was suppose to receive this by November 15th, here it is November 24th and no PS5! When I look at the tracking of it all it says is placed! I call Walmart and they tell me to cancel it and buy another one! Are you serious?! So I have to pay atleast $60 more?! I want the PS5 that I originally bought! My mother gave me money toward this on October 16th, she passed on October 18th very unexpectedly. This PlayStation means a lot to my son, plus he works at Walmart! I can't believe I'm have this goose chase like this when I should be mourning my mother, not worried about if my son is going to get his PlayStation or not! I'll gladly change my review when I get the console!"
"The package came brand new. The quality is really good, just like the real Apple AirPods and they were clean. It came with a charger so you don’t have to go out and get a new one. I ordered these for myself for Christmas and I’m so happy I purchased these. I am truly satisfied!"
"These are legit AirPods. They came in a sealed box and when I unboxed it, everything was fine. They die fairly quickly when listening to music but the charger is very fast and charge them back up within minutes. I almost didn’t get it because of the negative reviews but as long as you receive it sealed, it will be fine."
They came charged and clean. There wasn’t any dents/scratches or any indications that they were previously owned which means they’re probably new. They were tightly packaged but did come a day late… I think due to weather though. Overall I love them.
I love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽exactly what I was looking for 👍🏾if you are looking for that AirPods yes that is it
"When it arrived I got a email with the picture so I knew where it was at! The sound is amazing, you might need to change some settings tho. Came with a charger too (it was in the box btw, ive been using them for a while)."
"Buying these Apple Airpods with the charging case was one of the best purchased I’ve ever made. The sound quality of these earphones is amazing! I purchased them because I love listening to music and watching videos online. I think it is really cool that you can leave your phone on the table or even in another room and still be able to listen to music or a podcast without having your phone right next to you. Being able to walk around and listen to things wirelessly has given me so much more freedom to get things done around the house. Not only have these earphones given me more knowledge by being able to listen to audiobooks while cleaning the house, but they’ve also given me the motivation to want to keep multitasking, so I can learn new t..."
"The delivery method was terrible! I ordered as a Christmas gift for my child and this is how it showed up at my house. NO packaging, no bag, nothing to hide/camouflage from porch thieves! Needless to say, my child seen them on the porch so she will be one less Christmas surprise.  Very disappointed!!!"
"These are supposed to be “new” airpods. Yeah right. mine came dirty, with an opened box, and they didnt even have the decency to put any bubble wrap in the packaging. I am so angry. I did NOT want to buy used airpods."
"Got sold a faulty product. Literally first day of owning them the right pod doesn't even work, won't connect with the left pod nor show its battery life. Great lol, I tried contacting apple support and they couldn't find a solution. I've even tried looking up on YouTube to to solve this kinda problem and nothing work, and on top of all this I have to buy another pair even tho they sold me a faulty product. Ain't that great. Finna have to buy another pair of AirPods that have a chance of being faulty again!!! What the heck. Very very disappointed"
Please please double check your stuff once you receive it. I am truly angey with myself because i ordered these airpods. Picked then uo and when i looked in at the box it was all scratches up but i thought nothing of it. I sent them to puerto rico because it was a gift. Once my cousin opened the airpods.. turns out the airpods were used.. had dirt... were broken...had scratches. I didnt open them bexause it was a gift. But that was my biggest mistake. Some customer must have switched them out and returned their old ones.  I am surpirsed how people can just do this. Not im out 140 dollars... please guys.. make sure everything is all good
I received my package today. I just got home and opened the package and I received a pair of used  AirPods. The case is scratched all up and is dirty. I tried to pair them and only one work. I am so disappointed with what I received since I paid my money. Calling customer service in the morning
"I love the product but, I’m giving it a bad review due to the shipping method! As someone who works all day I can’t be home waiting for my package to arrive. So I expect my package to be safe and secure. This time this wasn’t the case, I got home and found just the box of the AirPods.. no packaging just the white box with the mailing sticker. I honestly expected more from Walmart..."
"Is this some type of sick joke ?  I got it in the mail today . The box had some rips and was already half way open . So I was already skeptical but I ignore it then .. I look inside to the see the airpods in the plastic and Sure it was wrapped up all nice and looked official but when I opened the box it was absolutely disgusting inside . It looked like these had been someone’s old used airpods they were dirty inside and out not to mention didn’t even want to connect to my phone , i am extremely disappointed in this"
"Excellent, pretty useful... easy to use and reliable. At first I had some doubts about it being reliable to my Mac as some Bluetooth speakers sometimes cut off, but these work great and are really comfortable to my ears. Aesthetically, they look great to me."
Oldie but feels like brand new
Right ear popped in my ear while shopping. Left ear piece was good. I think this set was previously used by someone else on my first day listening to music it advised me to turn it down. Max hearing over last 7 days. I haven’t had it for 7 days.
Much better than the gen 3 air pods.  These are smaller and feel like they fit better.  You can actually run with these without feeling like they will fall out.  Battery life is great.
"I brought the AirPods yesterday 05/15/2023, and the RIGHT AirPod doesn't work at all. I would like another one or a refund please."
I got tired of wasting money on 20$ Amazon EarPods from cheap brands I saw these on sale I dove on them. You won’t regret this purchase.
Great price during Black Friday! They put a smile on my 9 year olds face. She was able to connect to her phone by herself.
"I love Walmart. I go to Walmart about three weeks or so each week and when I saw a TikTok I  mediately check it out for myself when I saw it myself I was like wow and purchased the iPad. I have the whole Apple ecosystem, Apple I knew this purchase was going to be amazing I have no regret buying it. No issues fast shipping, I ordered it Wednesday and it got delivered to me Friday I love my iPad"
"I've been an Apple, products user, Fan since  long ago-- Macintosh era began. I've been a fan of technology and am self taught. And, over the years, I've learned to research prior to purchasing. This particular product is only used for personal reasons like emails, FaceTime, iTunes movies"
"I bought in November 2022 it’s the 64gb and I’ve had no problems with it, the battery last a long time for me.  And that’s a plus it also doesn’t get hot no matter how long I use it , or while charging it , like my iPhone does which I like.  I bought it because I needed one and I glad I did."
"I absolutely love my Ipad 9 generation.  The pictures are flawless,  all the features are easy to work.  I was able to add all my apps in minutes"
"I purchased this Ipad to pare with the Logitech keypad case and it fit perfectly!  The response between them is fast and clean and the size fits easily in my go bag.  Between the 256 gig storage and the cloud I have quick access to all my ""stuff"" I saved and need one and again!  Can't go wrong with Apple."
Like the size and price.  Well pleased
Wonderful price perfect purchase!! Thank
I love my Ipad I have no problems with it works  fast and good I use it for school. Also it came in 1 day shipping was amazing
"I really like it so far ,but the only thing is on the corner there’s like a cloud but the screen looks fine so I’m not sure if I should just return it or just deal with since everything works fine .I’ll share a picture I took .you rest can’t see it that good only from like the side ."
"The box was EMPTY! I called for help and they told me that it was not Walmart's problem, but my problem. And they cut the call.
POOR ATTENTION"
"This is an excellent tablet. Quite an upgrade from my old one. The sound and picture resolution are clear. I love the size. The sale price was good but it was cheaper at Target. Since I missed that same, I tried Walmart."
My order arrived a few days late and unfortunately there were scratches on the paint on the back of my new iPad
"Love it pretty basic for basic needs . Got 2. One for myself one for my daughter . We both enjoy for watching videos / movies , games activities etc 😇"
its so smooth i love it. very new.
I just needed it to watch movies when I travel since it’s got the biggest screen comparing to other ipads. Works great! And the cheapest with the latest gen.
Great quality for the price you pay
I love the iPad it's everything I thought it would be
"Budget friendly,.overall it's iPad 9th generation always updated from Apple."
The iPad doesn't charge and the included adaptor isn't Apple certified
"Love it, got it for nursing school and notes!"
Well everything came on time and the phone is working really really good. Now about the other people reviews I was hesitant about buying it at first but it works good for me and I’m using it now. Since I had another from from straight talk my old phone it was easy to transport my number over to this phone. And everything is on my new phone.
Great phone couldnt pass up the price. Comes brand new sealed in the apple box with a straight talk sim card. A
"Black on black iPhone is a thing
Photo upgrades ok"
It's  awesome! I love it and am so happy that i was able to obtain the iphone11
It's a good quality phone and I've been using it for the past couple months with little to no complaints
I have enjoyed my IPhone11. Have had no problems whatsoever and would buy it again
"phone is super good. fast, no issues with the device itself. only issue is the carrier… it’s good, but for some reason, it dropped out of nowhere when i was on the phone and the connectivity be off and on, but i think that’s based on coverage in the area. it’ll display “TFW” which is kinda eh to me cause i rather it display “straight talk,” but they’re under TFW so it makes sense. overall, a really good phone. i say it’s worth it, especially for 318."
"Terrible and upsetting 
Although my phone came in perfect condition it was advertised as a straight talk phone and locked to straight talk which is what we needed, I was on the phone for a very long time trying to figure out why this phone wasn’t working only to find out after two hours that the Sim card was for total by Verizon which isn’t compatible with straight talk
So then why was the phone advertised as straight talk if it was actually total by Verizon"
"The phone I received appears to be a refurbished phone in not new condition.  Although it came completely packaged, it had a passcode on it which caused us great stress Christmas morning trying to bypass it.  After restoring to factory conditions and getting into phone to transfer info, it was recognized as “kitte’s phone”.   Waiting for a call back from apple to find out if my assumptions are true."
"Not worth the time and effort, don't get me wrong the iPhone 11 worked great, everything was fast and snappy even for a 2019 flagship! But the customer support at Straight Talk is a joke, not only did they mess up my device activation, but also locked me out of my own Straight Talk Account after I got up to their corporate office about the activation not working. they changed the pin on my account and made it so I couldn't even change it. Making it the phone not usable as a phone but a glorified iPod Touch, I ended up returning the device and losing out on the money spent on the service plan. If you want an iPhone 11, get it with a different carrier or buy a carrier unlocked variant, as this is not worth the time to even get the phone usabl..."
Not only did our package arrive late it was also destroyed.
I love the size. Had to get a case its very slippery to hold.
"Works great, plenty of room for pics, great quality"
Love it so much!
"I tried to activate this phone, it wouldn’t! I called customer service for assistance, they were rude as usual. I HATE having to contact customer service. They are always rude and unhelpful. They could not get the phone to activate as well. I asked if I should get another 11, or try another phone. They didn’t answer the question, she just rudely told me to take the phone back. I reached out on their page to get more answers, they could not answer the question as well. I wish I had decent experiences through their customer service."
"Check with current carrier to see if your number is eligible to transfer.   You will need a PIN number before transferring to Straight talk.   They disconnect your old phone before activating new, so you are without phone until you have access to another line. 
 Activating since yesterday.  They took my payment at 1:18 and at 7:35 refused to turn it on till I made a another payment CSR said it did not go thru but it had cleared my bank.  GOT another CSR and the said they could see the payment on the history!  
STARTED PROCESS 11/22 around 1 pm been after multiple phone calls, it is now 1:30 pm next day still no service on iphone or my old phone.    After being on the phone 2 hours I was told they would call back in an hour.  Then I called b..."
"Very easy to set up and arrived in a perfect condition (New). I was very skeptical due to the reviews, but I decided to give it a try anyway and I'm glad I did. I love my new iPhone and it works just perfect so far, setting it up was very easy, it was done in just few minutes."
"I bought two phones to get one that still doesn't work correct. First phone would not stay on more than a couple minutes at a time. Literally could not set it up. Walmart exchanged it same day. Second phone I have now gets hot all of a sudden, when using keyboard, letter's appear that you're not even close to,(ie. hit J and f or d show up) phone freezes up all the time where you can't even turn it off, etc. It's something all the time. Phone never really works as it should for long. Had to go back to a spare 6s  just to have a working phone for now. PS. Bought this phone only 5 months ago."
We purchased two phones for Christmas during Black Friday sale . On Christmas we were able to activate one no problem. Sent the entire day trying to get the other one activated still not completed they are saying it’s linked to someone else account. If the phone is new how could this be! One happy kid and one that got disappointed
I bought the iPhone 11 64gb straight talk phone before Christmas. I cannot seem to get it to work with my WiFi. I live in an area that has no cellphone service because of mountains and need to use WiFi for messages but this will not let me set us messages on this phone.  Do not really like the phone either. It was hard to set up.  Difficult for an older person to use
"I wasn't sure if this would be big enough, but it is NICE. Perfect size….Not obnoxiously huge and not anywhere near small, this Tv is great. The picture quality is crystal and can be adjusted, so can the sound. The sound is amazing. I haven't turned it up to full volume, but it is pretty loud at 20. This was a great buy. PERFECT price."
This is my second time purchasing this tv. My daughter broke my first one in our move but u was so satisfied with how well the tv works and size that I repurchased for our new apartment. Highly recommend!
Accurate description. I've only had it like 1 day but so far pretty much as described. Performance good so far. I took the free 2 year warranty provided by Onn.
"too bad i cant give zero stars!
Terrible, was delivered November 28th 2022, yesterday half of the screen turns green only when trying to play a show, today entire screen is green with lines. display looks fine. but whenever you press play on a show you get green. its only 4mths old. no wonder it was being sold at a low price black friday deal my rear end! would of spent an extra $200 to get a few years life or at least A YEARS life span. UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERSTANDABLY DISAPPOINTED in purchase!😞"
"When the reviews say don’t get this tv, please listen. I bought this tv March 12, 2022. And as a few other people have stated, I have gotten a vertical line on the right side of the tv in August. Waking up this morning, there is a new vertical line almost right in the middle. It’s super frustrating because me and my spouse bought the tv at full price. Definitely feels as if we wasted around $300. Very very disappointing."
"The price is great but you get what you pay for! TV is 1 year old and started to melt on the left side, it's hot to the touch. This caused the screen to go out. Spend the money to get a real brand, don't waste it on this Walmart trash! onn. is cheap and will burn your house down! I'm glad I was home when it happened."
Save your money . Purchased this tv in April . Has lines going across the bottom of the screen and corner where there is a black spot gets hot . Back and fourth for two weeks with the warranty dept . They tried telling me it was physical damage even tho I watched this appear while using the tv . Now they are providing me with a label to send to them but I have to find my own box to ship it . Just don’t buy
I purchased this tv 5/22 and it sat in the box until 1/23. Like others have said don’t buy this tv. I’ve only used it for a few months now and the whole screen is full of pixel lines. That is terrible onn needs to replace my tv. See the picture provided for proof
Only had it since February and this is the replacement of my original one I had in January and the screen is doing the exact same thing. Glitching at the bottom. Except it waited until now to start glitching. Never had such trouble with a tv before. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
"This tv did not even last a year before issues arose. There are lines running through the screen in random spots. It was never physically damaged. I purchased this as a gift for my mom, not even a year ago. I have a warranty claim started, so hopefully that goes smoothly."
I purchased the TV in Feb of 2022 and we were watching it tonight and it went blank! It is mounted in the wall and from one second to next it was like this! Very very upsetting!
Fast shipping! We had originally ordered for it to be delivered yesterday but it was delayed and they shipped it for free. Expected to come Monday but came today. Perfect tv. Def a steal!
"I only had this a bit over a week before i noticed a red vertical line on the right side of the tv. Within a few days i noticed a small black horizontal line 3/4 to the top. I know its cheap, but man its really cheaply made too."
"Listen to me….!! I bought this tv in March, it’s November and suddenly I have these vertical lines in my tv. Half the screen randomly stopped working one day while I was gaming too. I’m so glad I purchased the warranty, thank God."
"I bought this tv tv on April 29th, less than a year ago, and now the picture is going out and the screen is dark on February 24th. No one expects to pay nearly $300 for a tv for it to stop working in less than a year."
We have had this TV for 10 and a half months and the screen suddenly started to look weird. At first it looked shifted a little. Now it is blurring every icon and there are lines crossing from side to side and streaks of color that look smeared upward from different places on the screen.
"purchased this tv for Christmas and it worked fine for the first 6 months. Two weeks ago, there was a couplebof green lines that appeared across the screen. TV is mounted so it's never touched. Quality is definitely affected. Will try to call Onn customer support for help."
"Love the tv ,it has a clear and beautiful picture.Worth the money.The only thing I dislike is the remote control because it doesn't have the numbers on it to go directly to the station you want."
Super.  I use it as my home office monitor for my laptop.  This 50-inch size lets me utilize 4 screens of 24-inch each for multiple apps running for website development.
Brought this tv 5 months  ago . It froze turned black then lines up and down . It’s not a reset issue tried that . I barely watched it.
"I am so happy with my purchase , my beats buds are in perfect condición, but the service is wonderful I like when I receive all the notifications about the product when is arriving or is a delay, thank you for all the hard work ."
Been thru 3 pairs of AirPods Pro these definitely better and actually stay on my ears
"They have good sound, if you love hip hop, reggae, and you like bass sounds and high volume these are very good.  I used them for 8 hours straight and they are very comfortable.  With contemporary Jazz and classical music they are heard very well.  If you are Latin and you like reguethon, these are the ones.  With HD music they sound great.  I have the MW07, MW08, MH40, powerbeats pro and beats studio 3. All very good with their differences in definition and fidelity.  Anyone who wants fidelity in sound should look for something more expensive that suits his preferences.  For me these are very good for their price.  If you are not willing to pay $ 250 for the MW07 or $ 300 for the MW08 you should seriously consider these earbuds."
"For their price they are very good.  I can work my entire 8 hour shift without feeling discomfort.  They are very comfortable and their sound is very good.  I have other more expensive ones, but I also like these."
"Ngl I was hesitant on buying these, but I’m glad I did. These are way louder than my AirPods….The bass is crazy when you’re listening to music. It even comes with 3 months free of Apple Music"
Product is great unfortunately was shipped white earbuds instead of the black that I ordered. Probably shouldn’t give customers an option
"Let me start by saying these are extremely comfortable and fit well. I find it difficult to find ear buds Im not constantly readjusting to fit well in my ear. The sound quality is 5/5. It’s more balanced than you would expect for beats since they are known for their heavy bass. Don’t get me wrong though the bass is still there! The passive noise mode works great I dont even need to take them out to hold a conversation. The noise canceling is pretty good, it doesnt block out extremely loud stuff if your music is on pause but with music playing you cant hear a thing in the world around you! Which is understandable since they are ear buds and not ear plugs. The worst thing about them is they advertise 8 hours of playtime and that’s supposedly ..."
"Perfect size for me. I like it, not too big or bulky, awesome tablet,  Price wise is not too expensive at all to me, inexpensive,  it's a good tablet so far, very affordable,"
"This tablet is the perfect size to hold while sitting in a chair, on the sofa, or while reclining in bed. It's has the dimensions of a personal-size bible (which is a little smaller than a hardcover book). I primarily use this tablet for reading books, online bible study and devotions, listening to podcasts, and watching YouTube videos.
You cannot beat Samsung for overall quality and a high-resolution display."
"It worked perfect right out of the box, no problems."
Son loves it! Good price
This is an amazing tablet.  I had previously purchased this one about 2 years ago and it lasted alot longer than expected for my young daughter to use. I loved it so much that I ordered this one to replace and update her current one. It's easy to use and set up. I would recommend this product.
"Great price at 109. Processor is definitely slower but screen is nice enough. Good for browsing, ebooks and email. Would have paid a little more for 64gb to store more apps, though nice to be able to add external SD card and have existing headphone jack."
"Its a nice tablet for simple tasks like emails, facebook, simple games, shopping apps, ect... Multitasking can be an issue, as in slow and occasional freezing. The tablet updated to Android 13 and presently has security update January 1, 2023.  Cases and screen protectors are available.  A usefull feature of the tablet allows you to connect to your samsung phone and send and receive texts.  I'd definately recommend the tablet for anyone who isn't looking for a pro device.  The price is good for the specs."
images and sound quality is good
Runs slow. Screen isn’t very responsive. I have to press down really hard it keep repeatedly doing the motion until it catches on. And I’ve only had it for a month..
Got my item and it's been opened. Returning it for an exchange or refund.
"I guess I'm not very bright. I thought the low price of this tablet meant prices went down because tablets have been around for many years now. It's really just an economy tablet. The camera lens sticks out the back, so it gets all scratched up in no time. It doesn't even have a flashlight! Also, when it boots up it says ""Secured by Knox"", but it doesn't have a secure folder, so I don't know what that's supposed to mean. I would have been willing to spend more for a better tablet, if I had just known."
"I like that it's small enough to fit in my purse, yet big enough to still see things like TV programs or city building games.  The functionality is great too."
"LOVE THIS! IT'S EASY TO USE AND VERY USEFUL FOR GAMING, OR WORK RELATED USES LIKE KEEPING SCHEDULES! EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS AWESOME INCLUDING THE PRICE I GOT IT FOR! THANK YOU WALMART!!!"
"Good tablet, runs fast enough processing for gaming for my elementary child. Only thing to keep in mind if buying in store is that walmart does not keep protective glass/child proof cases for the samsung tablets well stocked (this is consistent according to the employee) so i did have to order those separately online"
Bought for my Grand daughter. Checked upon receipt. Came charged and started right up - ready for easy setup. Incredible device at a very affordable price.
I purchased two of these for my kids as replacements for their other tablets. ive heard nothing but praises. They love the battery life and the size is great for gaming and learning.
"Cannot ask for more in a $109 tablet. Performs well, plenty of space for apps, bright display. Android 11 is current."
"Awesome little tablet that's perfect for browsing and watching videos.

May not be high end but certainly does the job for the price."
It's lightning fast and very lightweight. An excellent choice for people who want a great tablet at a reasonable price.
"Fast, excellent memory, EASY to get up and running everything.  Purchased for my wife and she is non- techy as they come"
Omg these are a great TV  3 rd one same brand all different sizes this one is for my kitchen counter. Easy set up with Wi-Fi and a lil rabbit ears for my local channels . Highly recommend
"Undoubtedly the easiest home delivery ever and believe me I love Amazon.
Product was a super great price and setting up process was remarkably easy. You will sell more!"
The box came in in perfect condition. Tv was easy to install and set up. Perfect screen and volume for a bedroom. If you are looking for a Tv for a bedroom under a hundred bucks this is the best choice!
I'm using it for outside viewing.  Exactly what I wanted. Light as a feather.  Lighter in weight than my iPad5.  Sound leaves a little to be desired.  BUT you can plug in a speaker.  Also this TV allows you to turn off the picture on leave the sound on. Perfect for me as I love background noise.
I love my ONN 32-in Roku TV. It is exactly what I needed. I have recommended this brand to others. One person that I recommended it to has ordered three of them.
"Obviously, if you see a tv less than a certain price youre gonna wonder if its not great. Well. Let me tell you, this one is!  I would pay this price over and over again for this tv. 

The brand isnt wellknown. But it needs to be.

I love how the tv is the roku device. Weve gone through so many devices. Switching btween hdmis is easy. And it comes with an all in one remote so you can controll volume too."
"I was very pleased with this onn. HD Roku Smart TV, particularly where I'd never heard of the onn. brand before. It's great having the Roku feature built right in the tv, and not have to attach anything extra. This Smart TV makes it very easy to watch all the tv and movies you want! Setup is very easy. Once you turn on the power, it guides you step by step right through the entire setup, including a software update. You do need to set up a Roku account from your tablet, phone or computer, but it is free. You even have the option to skip the credit card section for paid streaming services if you prefer. It plays a quick ""how to"" video to explain how to use the tv and remote and make your way through the menu and all it's options. Adding addi..."
"I was looking for a small tv for my office, and found this for a discounted price. Easy set-up and it has all the apps that you need for streaming! So far so good!"
"I ordered the TV for delivery because I had had surgery the day before and won't be able to walk for months, when the TV arrived my caretaker put it together and was about o get it set up when she plugged it in it was broken. We couldn't have them reshoot it because we didn't have the time she had to go back to work and I am bedridden and cannot drive to pick it up within the 15 days they say to return in even though I had paid for the 3 year warranty. I called in to return and pick up a new one for my recovery, not only would they not bring one to costumer service for me as I cannot travel far distances, but they made me come in wait whilst they tried the TV and as my friend went back to get a new TV to replace it.. thank fully Shari was w..."
"Purchased this item 10/22 it is now 11/23 and the TV is useless with color lines running down the screen. This isn't even my major TV unit, I have maybe turned it on 10 times since purchase.  WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK@"
"This isn't the same quality as a $1,000 TV, but for under $90 it's a really good deal. The speakers aren't the best, but the picture quality is awesome and you can hook up external speakers if you really need to. We (me and 5 year old kid) watch it daily and the sounds quality has never bothered us. 

The picture is 720p and it's a really bright, clear picture. You can adjust the brightness so it's lower at night, it's bright enough that a sunny room doesn't affect it. The remote is easy to use, I could see this being an easy thing to use for my tech-hesitant parents. I use it as my kitchen TV, it's very light so I keep it right on my counter and can set it aside easily when I'm cleaning. My kid likes to take it to his playroom to watch c..."
"The setup process was very easy, and the only tool you will need is a Phillips screwdriver to install the two leg stands that are included. Next, make sure you have either a computer, cell phone, or any other device that has an Internet connection so that you can register the product and also sign up for a Roku account or use your existing one.

Similar to an onn. 50 inch 4K version that I own, the screen menus were well organized and easy to navigate through. The picture quality and other settings has a large selection of choices and/or adjustments to fine tune things to your liking, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that a TV this size contains a ""Game mode"" in the settings too. Since I am a gamer, this is a welcome feature to ..."
"I was very excited to be offered a small Roku TV. I have no cable in my bedroom or sewing room and this is a very cool TV to have in a room that only has internet service. 

First it is extremely easy to set up. I actually had it in front of my other TV while doing it. It ran through a list of likes and dislikes to know what content I prefer. Super cool! It requires no extra plugs if you have wireless internet service. When i was setting it up, the TV searched for a wireless service and found mine right away. I merely had to enter my password and off it went downloading content. You do need to set up a Roku account on a separate device such as a smart phone or computer. There is no credit card or payments necessary. There is loads of free..."
"The 24 class 720P ONN Roku smart TV has a lot of great features! We love that all of the channel options are easy to locate and use (no need to change TV inputs) which is much easier to navigate for older and really young users. Our elderly parents sometimes get confused with changing TV inputs to get to their viewing options and the ONN Roku Smart TV eliminates that extra step. It comes with a standard ROKU remote (see picture) which is about 1 1/2"" by 5 1/2"". I also like that there are control buttons (see picture) on the side so the TV is still operable if the remote is misplaced. The kids love that it has games included even though you have to watch many ads before they can start to play (one game had 9 ads!!!). The picture is bright an..."
"This 24"" Smart TV is a perfect fit for my needs! I wanted a smaller tv, lightweight, that I could easily move from a bedroom to the porch or wherever I needed it. This is very easy to carry and lightweight. Beautiful picture and was easy to setup. All instructions for setting it up are right on the screen soon as you turn it on. Most of the apps are already on it, just create an account or sign in plus you can add more apps. Now it's time to purchase in a larger size for family room!"
"i love my new Smart tv. easy setup. love the sound all the channels are crisp and clear. New experience for me. From  analog to digital and no costly cable service, I've fallen in love with my new Roku smart. now I have endless viewing thanks to Walmart great selection of dependable  products."
"This 24"" flat screen 720P is a surprise in it's clear sharp picture, responsive remote and fit in small space size is perfect for guest room, kid's room or kitchen or home office..
The legs are sturdy enough and the set up is no different or more complicated than any smart TV.
We stream here, and the tv sets up easily for YouTubetv or other streaming services. There is a dedicated Netflix button on the remote.
So if you're looking for a smaller space or 3rd tv, I'd definitely check this out.
See photos for picture clarity. The sound is clear too, but better in a smaller space.."
"This TV is perfect in my daughter's room. It fits nicely on her desk and has all the bells and whistles to be able to watch all the streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Disney+. All we had to do is plug it in, connect to wifi and it was up and running! So convenient! The sound it as good as you would expect out of a smaller device, the picture is very crisp and clear! The remote is simple and easy to use. Good product, one we would recommend."
"This tv was just the right size and very lightweight for the space we hung it in the kitchen we had. I love the Roku features and the picture is pretty good, but the sound quality of the speakers on any setting is not good. We ended running an aux cord from the tv’s headphone jack to an external speaker. Not ideal, but now the setup works really well. One thing about the Roku remote (which is the same on pretty much all Roku enabled TVs) I wish it had numerical inputs. It would be nice to be able to just type 11 when I want to go to channel 11."
"Overall this TV is great!! Setup was very easy. Since we own other Roku boxes all I had to do was sign into my Roku account and it downloaded all our favorite apps. The TV has 3 HDMI inputs, a headphone jack and an optical input for a sound bar. The picture is great for a 720p TV. The remote has quick access buttons for Netflix, Hulu, Roku TV and VUDU. I also love the volume and mute buttons on the side. The only downside is the sound. It sounds like it's coming from a can. We found a work around by using our little Bluetooth speaker with an aux cord. Quick and easy fix."
"I bought it last week. At time of purchase delivery was gonna be one week, to my surprise they delivered it the same day! The tv is awesome. Set up is a breeze, i got all the streaming services connected. Bought a Nintendo switch oled for my daughter it looks awesome on it. Soooo happy. Will mount it on wall this weekend."
"Loveeee the price! Very nice. Almost bought Phillips instead but compared the two and went with the cheaper one! Unfortunately they couldn't ship, so I put 2 ratchets on and drove it 45 min home 😭 I was going 40/50 on the freeway at times and 2 sheriffs passed me on my way. I'm sure they pitied me. But anyway im Super happy. If I could I would buy another ❤️"
"Great size, took a bit to get used to. We had a 55” and the picture is very nice. Sound is wonderful too. Love having one remote with built in Roku, a few of my tv's didn't have Roku built in."
I was telling my wife I think this is the best TV we ever had but it's new so my last TV only lasted 15 months so if I get 5 years out of this TV this would be my best TV ever I really like it you can do so much on it
"I have only had my onn 65"" Roku TV for a month or so so I cannot fairly give a 5 star rating since not enough time has passed to see how durable and long lasting it is. Maybe in a few years, but for now I CAN fairly assess it as a great television so far. The sound and the picture are both clear and rich. The remote control is simple and compact so very easy to handle and operate. Setup was quick and easy and navigation is as well. I REALLY like the live TV pause and rewind option too and couldn't believe how simple it was to set up and is to utilize. But... this is my second month of my second tv set after having to return the first one I bought when it got a few vertical black lines on the right side of the screen after barely two months ..."
Arrived damaged. Saw the box had a whole in it and they delivered it anyway. Now my time is wasted waiting on the delivery service to pick up the item. Return said it would be here between 10 and 2..it's now after 5pm and raining. Called customer service for advixe..I have now been on hold for over 20 minutes.  No follow-up or anyone checking on me...guess they are hoping for a hangup. This is ridiculous..
"I ordered my first tv Walmart.com and the first picture was the first tv, so i had to wait for them to pick it up and arrive at the warehouse to receive another tv. I ordered it February 28th and i didn’t think it was fair i had to wait until they received it back at the warehouse before they would sent out a replacement because it would’ve possibly been a 2 week wait, so i decided to order one from my local Walmart through online curbside and as you can see the second tv was also damaged. I had to go through so much just to get the tv back into my car and return to the store. Finally the 3rd tv worked out. I had them plug in the tv at the store to make it worked before i took it home. I would never order another tv through Walmart without ..."
"Was instock locally they used Pilot to ship. They didn't  answer for a week after it showed it was suppose to be delivered, left voice mails. Tried to contact Walmart with no help. Finally I get a call saying we are 15 mins out but I'm 45 mins away from my house. They said it required a signature but they didn't get one from my son that was home and to top it off they shattered the tv. Looks like pilot tossed boxes on it, and the whole box was damaged. Now in to return called right away after I got home and checked it, on hold for 35 mins and then got a employee who assured me I would get my return label in minutes, nothing it's next day."
"Originally ordered for in-store pickup.  Showed available and in stock.  Ordered updated that it was no longer available, only option was to ship to me.  Just arrived damaged.  Bottom of box was wet and delivery company had the tv strapped in backwards on the forklift, with the screen bearing all the weight of the tv, the entire thing was cracked and covered in lines once I turned it on."
"Bought TV for use in Airbnb and TV went blank after less than 6 months of minimal use. Would not recommend. Sent information to warranty, waiting to see if they will do anything about it. Had to buy another Tv as I cannot wait weeks to get issue resolved through warranty. Would rather buy a better tv and not have to go through this issue."
"I purchased 2 tvs from them 75 inch onn and 85?inch Samsung. They delivered my 75 inch onn tv yesterday and but it's still saying out for delivery 
And not only that it's still marked for delivery 
They got my Samsung saying it was delivered same time they dropped off the onn tv and have my Samsung 85 inch marked for delivered when I never received the tv !! So there for they delivered my onn tv 75 inch but it's still marked as on its way! So I decided to open the onn roku tv . When I open the tv the screen had a huge crack in the middle 
What do I do because the number they provide doesn't work when you call customer service!! And the text chat seem to be getting nowhere ! I just want what I ordered and a replacement!! But I can't get in t..."
"For a 65"" roku tv, you could not ask for any better deal, in terms of price, quality, clarity and size. No regrets buying this tv. If you are shopping for any size roku tv, look no further. I highly recommend  the onn roku tv. I bought 2 onn tv in less than 3 months (43"" & 65""). Thats how satisfied I am."
"Exactly what I was hoping it to be. I bought this tv because I hated the Samsung that it replaced. Mostly hated the Samsung remote. This has the standard Roku remote and I couldn't be happier. Utilized standard mounting equipment to hang on the wall. Much lighter than I expected. And because of the great price, probably gonna buy another for the bedroom."
I love my tv the only problem I have is in the screen you can see four spots and two lines on the black screen that look like finger prints but other then that my tv shows up clear and plays great quality 10/10 I love it will buy again and has recommended this company too other people thanks again so much
"This tv died after watching it for an hour. It's a shame because during that hour of watching it, the picture quality was great. After watching it for an hour, went to bed,came down for some water and noticed the screen flashing on and off and no picture."
"First one I bought the screen was cracked, took it back to Walmart and they exchanged it for me. This tv is big and the picture is crystal clear. Volume is amazing goes up really loud. So far I am very happy with this tv specially for the price."
It's a little confusing at first but I'm learning . I like being able to watch so many different movies and tv shows that I love as I feel like watching them.
"Beautiful picture. Love the no picture, only audio option. Looks very similar if not better than my Samsung. I've only had it three months though. Also love the Cherry Blossoms screen saver. Matches my room aesthetics perfectly."
"At first the tv was working good no issues, than out of nowhere the picture starts to go in and out, I’m currently unable to watch tv. Tv is 11 months bought on 2/24/22 barely lasted a year."
"I didn’t even get to use the tv!! When it came the screen was full of lines and messed up. Couldn’t get a replacement because they were out of stock and can’t get a refund until the other one is picked up and I was told they had no idea when someone would be back in my town for pick up. So now, I have no tv and out over $600"
"I hate having stuff shipped to me from FedEx due to my apartment complex (Idk why but only USPS and UPS have access into the building.. we don’t have a code, it is a keyed entry). When I found out that that was who would be delivering I got worried I wouldn’t receive them. I don’t know if the seller gets to chose this option, but this is the first time anything shipped by FedEx got delivered to a FedEx location when they weren’t able to get into my building. As for the seller, I saw a few bad ratings that they received used or refurbished. That was not the case for me, from what I could tell they are brand new like I ordered still in the cellophane wrapping. Processing and shipping was super fast, got them like four days after I ordered. I ..."
"The Beats Pro Wireless are the only way to buy wireless earbuds. They're more than worth the money. They're comfortable AF, I wore them for hours the other day from working on the laptop, to working out, then going for a walk on the beach. They're user friendly, easy to setup. I love the protective case and the case is a charger for the buds too! The case charged really fast, the ear bud knew when it was in my ear and automatically connected to my phone!!  I LOVE THEM - some ppl complained about the way they sit in the case how they sit on opposite sides of the case.. but I don't see what the big deal is. You take it out of the case and put it in your ear. Who cares which bud is what side of the case.... Some ppl also said the case is too b..."
"Great headphones for cycling, running and playing Frisbee golf !
I tried Jabra, AirPods and AirPods Pro.  These are easily my top pick !  
The battery life of the earphone charges (and the case too) is 2X the AirPods.
Important : The fit is crucial.  Take time to experiment with the different size tips.  To my surprise my ear canals are large and the factory tips sounded lousy.   2 big advantages are
the each have a physical volume control.  The also have 1-2-3 tap functions on each side
with a physical button, not a touch-sensitive style tap.  The ear loops may not be for everyone
but they are moldable, soft and a life saver.  ( I almost lost an AirPod on a bumpy Boston bike ride. )
These Powerbeats Pro sound plenty loud, are sweat proof a..."
"I read the reviews and decided to buy new. They were as described and functionally sound. They wear well and over all, I like them better than my Bose Soundsport Free. The only thing I can complain about is that the red isn't as bright as I thought from the internet pix. It's a cross between red and pink, maybe salmon if that's a real color? But I absolutely recommend these, and buy new.  The $30 you could save, probably isn't worth it."
Awesome !
Came quickly works great!!
"Be prepared to replace frequently.  These are a replacement for a 2 year old out of warranty pair that stopped working.   Now i'm already having some issues with these.  Worse part?   The warranty started when Walmart's reseller bought them from Apple, NOT when I purchased them 4 months later.  An hour on the phone with Apple could not fix the issue.  Beware"
"Purchased these to replace my old pair. Upon arrival, I put them to charge overnight. Attempted to connect and no luck. iPhone is up to date, Bluetooth is on and would not connect. Researched why these pair would not connect and was suggested to reset them by holding down pairing button for at least 15 seconds or until LED began to blink red and white. After trying everything, finally concluded that they were defective. I will be sending them back to seller."
I order a new pair of beats and received a use pair
"Too many design flaws. Headphones never sit correctly in the case so you can't guarantee if they are charged when you want to use them. If they were charged, a single headphone may turn off randomly leaving you with just one headphone for the rest of your run/workout. I called customer support and the only options were to pay $200 to repair or buy new ones for $250. When I had issues with my Trekz Air headphones they replaced them. Would 100% stay away from the PowerBeat Pros and go try out the Trekz Air."
"i got these as a christmas present for my bestie, and they accidentally put them in the washer,, completely submerging them for 20mins before they realized where they were. after the headphones were out of the washer, they still worked. and worked just as well. the case still works as well. 10/10. worth the money."
They are so easy to pair. The charge is long lasting. The sound quality is superb and they’re lightweight and attractive looking. I just find them to be a little uncomfortable for my small ears. I love them.
"Sound quality is great, they stay on your ears fantastically, battery life is quite impressive last close to 9 hours of runtime, love the charging case over all extremely happy with this purchase!!"
"I hate rating bad reviews but it’s only been 4 days since I’ve received them and I’ve had so many problems already. On day two the headphones started cutting out and I don’t know why, I restarted both headphones and my phone but it continues. Everytime I get a notification it starts to cut out and the music stops playing. Other than that they’re were very pretty."
My review is TWO FOLD. %231. The ear buds worked for about a week and now one of them is TOTALLY dead. So I. Hoping this is a one time issue and I will try to replace them because I really liked them when I got them. I like the “over the ear” holder as opposed to just inserts.
These great headphones are awesome however the round circle the sits in the ear above the inner ear rubber bud is huge for small ears. In ten minutes of wearing them my ears hurt bad so it's not a fit for all size ears. Again it is not the rubber which it comes with 3 different sizes but the actual plastic part of the set that sets inside the ear before the inner ear rubber.
"They look good however the connection is wear. It takes multiple tries to connect to my Samsung devices. Sometimes it wil not connect to certain headphone, as I use one at a time and this is very inconvenient. I have had $30 headphones connect faster than this pair of beats. The app does not remember my pair of beats and I often have to sync it again and again. Once reconnected my chosen name for beats pops up, but I would not purchase again or recommend. I have had them for about a year with moderate use due to the technical defects."
"Wireless, cord less charging case, perfect to the ear, I feel pressure after using for over an hour, I think I need to get used to it. Love it!"
"Awesome headphones. Better than AirPods I believe, you can skip and go back and even adjust the volume on both ears."
"the ear buds are very high quality and many hours of charge. my old ones from amazon, only lasted 4 hrs. Beats are way longer. id guess 8 or 9hrs. they also usually run around 200. or more. i found a great sale for 159."
it's a great phone to use I love portrait mode and iOS 16 I would recommend buying this phone this is a great phone to you this is my first iPhone SE 2nd generation I had the iPhone SE first generation some years ago now I got the iPhone SE 2nd generation it's in great condition no problems I love this iPhone SE with straight talk wireless I would recommend buying this phone thank you
I really like it and I glad I switch Friday Android take a bit to get use to it is definitely different now I won’t go back to Android
"I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 obviously I hate upgrading phones but I’m very happy I got the SE and at the promotional sale price I got it for! Win Win! {Even though some of my accessories was not in the box as promised, customer service made a ticket and they have been shipped separately.} I still stick with my rating for my particular standard."
"I loved the price and size is perfect. I don’t care for the bigger screen phones , that is why I have a tablet for. An the fact that all the inner workings of the iPhone 11 or it may of been iPhone 12 are in the IPhone SE 2020. Either way I was very happy with the price and product.And with the Qi capability it basically set itself up."
"I love my phone but didn't give it a 5 star because the battery health started to go down after 2 months of use. I'm very upset about this, a new phone shouldn't do that that fast. My battery is at 96% and it's 4 months old. This is my second one, the last one started that at a year. Only reason I got a new one was because of the battery.🤦🏼‍♀️"
I love the new camera I was in a car ( not the driver) I took a picture of the sky of a storm rolling in. I made the comment that it probably wouldn’t look good since we were moving. When I reviewed the photo I was amazed that it looked like I was standing still. The camera is awesome. The phone has all the best that the original had just of course faster. The only thing I had to get used to was that it is in the body of a 7 and not the original size. Which at first I was disappointed with and u had to order new cases. But I am used to it now and enjoying it
"Very small screen and it’s very much like the IPhone 6.  Had to update my phone because some of my apps would not update on my iPhone 6. I am retired and can’t afford much. This will work for the time being. 
Features — 
Small Screen Display
Speakers are Great !
Nice Camera
Nice Video
*Very Nice Capability of Scanning Barcodes
( I use it a lot at Walmart, Dollar General and Scanning My Receipts For Cash Rewards Apps.  Walmart Should Offer a Special Purchase Just For Us Seniors."
I disliked that I was robbed. I bought these as Christmas gifts and when they went to open it the box was empty not a phone on site. This was my first and last time ordering on here
"This phone is Verizon , says locked to straight talk but the 611 number dialed Verizon could not turn phone on without spending extra money"
"Do not buy!! We bought 2 iPhone and neither will activate, even after multiple minute plans bought. We called straight talk for hours- they will not activate. No phone number, texts, calls, data, nothing. After a quick search of Facebook, Straight talk is under serious fire for many other people IN THE PAST 30 DAYS having the same issue. Straight talk will not issue a refund, nor will they let you speak to a supervisor. They promise you a phone call back in 10-15 minutes and never call back. Or flat out, hang up on you. It's all over yelp, facebook posts, and multiple other online review places. Please Google Straight talk before buying these. I had Straight talk a few years ago and they were fine- they were bought out and are no longer any..."
"This is an awesome phone for the price.  It takes excellent pictures and is ready pretty much as fast as i can hit the camera button.  Even though its missing the low light settings of other iPhone 11's its still not bad.  Having came from a budget Android and pretty much getting to the point of hating my phone I love my phone again.  Size does matter, haha.  I bought this for its smaller size and I have no regrets.  This phone has the processor of the iPhone 11's packed into a smaller case and lacking some low light camera features for less than half the price."
"Great phone for my 6 year old, keeps him off mine"
This phone is perfect for someone just wanting an updated iOS
My twin boys love this phone. They enjoy FaceTiming on WiFi. It’s really no need to purchase a used phone when you can get this new phone for only $100.
Phone itself was in perfect condition. I just got the wrong phone so I returned it to Walmart. It’s been over a month now it’s been talking to customer service and managers of Walmart. Talking to my bank. Still have not gotten a refund. It’s nearly Christmas and I would like my money back. I know it’s not a lot for some people but it’s a lot for me. I’d like to put it toward my kids Christmas or getting a gift for my husband. My issue hasn’t been resolved after talking to several people so I’m not sure what else to do. So that may be leaving a review here my someway help and get my refund.
"This phone is really nice! It has really quick response and is super fast. If you are thinking 
About getting this iPhone, just GO AHEAD AND DO IT!! You will not be disappointed."
"Love it. Upgraded from a iPhone 6. Pic editing is a lot better, when I click a filter or something it does it almost instantly whereas on the 6 it would take a bit and sometimes crash. Basically lag free. Will enjoy it for months"
"THE WORST PHONE EVER, I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND USED AUTPPAY WHICH DIDN'T HAPPEN, I LITERALLY SPOKE WITH CUSTOMER SEVICE DAILY FROM FEB 15TH UNTIL MARCH 20TH . BY THEN I COULDN'T EVEN RETURN THE PHONE DUE TO 30 DAYS HAD PAST. THEY SAID IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE THE PHONE THAT WONT ALLOW IT TO GET REFILLED, SO IF THE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THEN WHY NOT SHIP ME A NEW PHONE SO I BASICALLY PAIR 249 FOR A PHONE THAT WE CAN ONLY USE FOR INTERNET. i HAD TO BUY MY KID A WHOLE OTHER PHONE FROM THE COMPANY I WANTED TO USE TO BEGIN WITH, BUT SHE ALREADY HAD AN ACCT WITH THESE PPL SO WE USED THM"
"Super quick, easy and cheap purchase! Would definitely order again! I've always purchased cheap little smartphones from this website and they all worked very well and lasted a long time! Even though I've heard of other people who had problems with the phones they ordered from this website but I have yet to have any problems with any of my orders so far.."
The phone did not have a sims card. I was told straight talk would send me one. After waiting several weeks and it not showing up. I reached back out to straight talk and someone told me I would have to purchase a sims card.which I thought I was doing when I bought the phone.
"so far so good, just bought a house with all hardwood floor and cannot keep up with all of the dust with my Swiffer.  When i saw the price for this I bought it and am so happy, now my floors are dust free.  I do sometimes use the remote to make it go where i want it to go and love the way it edges around the chair legs that collect tons of dust."
"I really love this vacuum, it does my house very well, I have 1 dog and 2 cats, it gets all the hair up, it doesn’t have a pattern sensor, but that’s okay by me, and for some reason it won’t hook up to my Wi-Fi, but I only do it when I’m home anyways so it doesn’t matter. I love having the remote so if I need extra cleaning in a room I can direct it there. I just ordered another one for the bottom half of my house. I also love that it docks itself, this is a really good vacuum, and the price is so cheap. I have a friend that has 2 of the really expensive ones, and they don’t do nearly as good, they were impressed with this one."
"So far I am really enjoying it. I only have hard floors and it keeps them looking great. 
Pros
1. Picks up all of the pet hair (1 dog and 2 cats)
2. Battery lasts a long time on hard floors
3. It doesn’t make enough noise to be annoying
4. My cats find it very entertaining 

Cons
1. Sometimes it can’t find the base
2. You can’t map the floors out or put up boundaries 
3. It sometimes gets wedged up under the couch and I have to fix it.

I couldn’t let this run while sleeping because the kids leave too much stuff out that can get stuck in the brushes. I usually let it run while I’m doing other things around the house. I got this on sale and it was definitely worth the price. I would buy another and I plan on buying a version that allows mapp..."
I have a 75 lb dog and 2 cats and this has kept my floors so clean. The cats love following it around as it’s cleaning
"This was a great purchase! It works on all flooring and picks up everything. When I empty it, I can’t believe what’s inside! I might buy 2 more for the other 2 levels of my house."
"Great robot vacuum that does a great job with pet hair. has a decent run time and actually collects lots of stuff everytime it runs. We love our robot vacuum and wish we got one sooner. Transitions seamlessly from hard wood to carpets to rugs without issue. We have named her Cubey and cant live without her.

Only downside is that you cant map an area for it, so it just runs around aimlessely picking up stuff, but it still does very well in this regard."
"This is the second Eufy I have purchased. I believe it to be smarter than the Roomba because I tried that and returned it (for my second Eufy). Having the app and running it on a daily schedule works great for me because I have two dogs and lots of dog hair on the floor. Eufy runs for about an hour but can be programmed for less time and once she is done she heads back to her charging station. I do empty out the tray every other day, other than that VERY little attention on my part."
"I love my eufy robovac!! It vacuums my whole house which is about 1,600sqft. I keep my house extremely clean, so I have to empty the vacuum once a week, and it runs every morning at 8. I love the fact that you can program it around your schedule. It’s worth $149. Also the app lets you know everything going on with the vacuum. Whether it’s stuck, cleaning, needs to be empty the app will alert you. My favorite Feature will have to be the edge cleaner, it cleans right against the corners, and wall around the whole entire house. It also has no problem going from hardwood floor, tile, to rugs without getting stuck. I’m excited that they’re going on sale for $99 for Black Friday, because everyone in my family is getting one for Christmas this yea..."
"This vacuum arrived USED!!! I thought i looked like the box had been opened and then taped back shut so I decided to check it out.  The cords are unwrapped, there is no manual, parts are missing and there is GROSS HAIR and other DISGUSTING stuff in the roller!  I am appalled! What if I had wrapped this and given it for a Christmas Present without checking????!!!!!"
"Trying to operate since one week, finally new the battery is not Charging.The charging indicator will flash for couple of times, then stop. Going to call the warranty department for replacement of battery otherwise going to return."
"I absolutely love this item. It picks up so much dust and hair( I have 7 pets and Im amazed at how much pet hair it picked up) 
I love this machine, it knows when its about to bump into something and turns itself b4 it bumps into a wall or door etc. I highly recommend this machine if you are too busy or tired to vacuum. The pic I listed below is just from one hallway"
"I have 2 large dogs and was having trouble keeping up all the time with the hair. I am very happy to say that this vacuum is a huge help. I love it. I have vinyl plank flooring and a few small carpets and it gets everything even along the cabinets and under the kitchen table and bar, with all the chairs and stools in the way. I dont see hair anywhere. 
I do wish someone would have said that these vacuums are like a toddler. :) you have to move things that it may get stuck on or knock over. It finds any cords you have loose and gets stuck on them and knocks over my dog gates if its leaning up against the wall. Anyway as you can tell, I love it!! I wish I bought one a long time ago!  I do run it twice a day to keep up but with a push of a but..."
"This little thing is great. I run it every night for 30 minutes and my floors feel clean to bare feet. The battery has to recharge after a 30 minute run. Do heed the warning about picking things like wires off the floor, as it will get hung up on them. Having trouble syncing to my phone but it comes with a standalone remote that supports my needs."
"This RoboVac can be used without Wifi, which is really helpful. I did not realize just how dusty my tile floors were until I emptied the vacuum and WOW! How have I lived without this my whole life?! It picked up dust, dirt and my Labrador's pet hair very well. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
"This was the top rated budget friendly robovac on many review channels and I’m glad I bought it. It can go over most thresholds about an inch high and doesn’t get caught on simple things. Very good at cleaning tight spaces. Most of my house is hardwood so It’s good for bare floors. I also have 5 pets in the 1,200 square foot house so I’ve got it set up through it’s app to clean everyday and it picks up all the fur, hair, and dirt that’s on the floor. The only reason i didn’t give it 5 stars is because it’s gotten caught on a few things, and I’ve had to clean the brush on the bottom because it got clogged with hair! Otherwise, a good choice!"
"Does a good job cleaning with a combo of hard wood, tile and carpet in our home. I believe a larger  capacity battery for longer run time would be a plus. Durability has yet to be determined, but so far so good. My dog, on the other hand, rates it much lower, just sayin'."
"This vacuum is great for my apartment even though we have a lot of obstacles for it to get around. While it tries its best, it doesn't get in every crack and crevasse while cleaning so its better for a maintaining clean. I still would deep clean with a regular vacuum due to having pets and lots of nooks around my place. Overall I really enjoy this vacuum and have found no issues with this brand overall. Its nice to have it running while doing other chores so that you can accomplish a little more in less amount of time."
I love this vacuum! It was easy to set up on WiFi and I have it scheduled to clean everyday at 11:00.  My floors really look nice.  The dirt collecting bin is easy to empty and holds quite a bit.  It is very quiet and runs a long time before it self docks.  My dog isn't afraid of it.  The price is affordable and well worth the money.
"First off, I’m not a brand snob, but I do prefer quality over cost when it comes to things like this. I had never heard of the Eufy brand so I was skeptical.  Let me tell you, this things is AHHHHMAZING! I have an English Bulldog who sheds constantly and I added two kittens to the mix because they were homeless, brother and sister and who could say no?! I also have horrible allergies so between the pet hair and stepping on litter while barefooted, I was at my wits end! This is a game changer!!! I run it everyday after the kids go to school. Oh, did I forget to mention I have 3 kids as well? 
I’m so pleased to say that I can walk barefooted and not step on one crumb or one piece of litter! 
Now, I do want to be completely transparent so I’ll..."
"This is my first Robovac, and I love it. I can definitely tell the difference from before I bought it to now when walking barefoot in my house. This thing collects so much dirt and dust that I feel everyone needs one. I've only been in my house for a month and clean pretty often, but this vaccuum made it look like I don't. Setup was easy, and the tools provided really help to keep the vaccuum working well and free of hair (I have long hair and it wraps around the brushes easily). The only negative things I will say are that it's not possible for the vaccuum to be running while I'm not home because it tends to get stuck under my couch and TV stand, and the battery life isn't the best. It does have the ability to cover my whole first floor in..."
"It looks really nice,  keeps the room really comfy.  Just looking at the fireplace MSU you feel warmer. Took my daughter about 3 hours to assemble with no hurrying.  Only tool needed that was not included was a hammer,  some of the shelves had trouble fitting together. turned out beautiful. This kept our den,  open kitchen and dining area at about 70°, with it 23°outside. The TV in the picture is a 55 inch,  plenty of room for a 65""."
This was super easy to put together. The box was heavy so you will need some help putting it together. But is beautiful once you put it up . The only thing I didn’t like was the fact that the fireplace didn’t come with a remote . But beside that it looks really sleek
"I love this product! I purchased this item twice. The first time I tried putting it together by myself and that was an epic fail! The second time I paid for the expert assembly and it was money well spent! My pro was awesome and very professional. If you’re not handy or don’t have help, pay for the assembly. The finished product is beautiful. The fire place is beautiful and looks very realistic. Can’t beat this for the price. The 5 stars is for the finished look. I would rate it 1 star for ease of assembly, but I am not good at projects."
"The thing is GORGEOUS once you put it together! 
BUT!… putting it together is RIDICULOUSLY HARD! 
Also came covered in dust, scratches present and chipped pieces. Not too noticeable from far away but up close it is noticeable. 

Definitely have 2 people because this baby is a beast. Also, set aside 2 hours because the other reviews aren’t lying…It’s time consuming. 
Also, make sure you and the person working together on this have a strong relationship because you WILL break out into a fight a few times over this dang thing. Besides all that, it came out nice and I still have my partner and a cozy home! Photo is missing the shelves because I was worn out from building it, forgot there were shelves…"
"Was very disappointed, went through all the trouble putting it together, and was so exited. I pulled out the fireplace, put it in the insert and it had two big dents at the top. Very noticeable. Can I just a replacement on the fireplace, cause I don’t want to go through the trouble of putting a whole new one back together. The stand itself was perfect, just the fireplace had damages to it."
"It’s easy to put together even for one person. The fire place works great. It looks pretty. But it came out of the box damages. Almost every piece was chipped. The assembly made some of the chipped areas worse. I know it’s the quality of the price, but did it have to be chipped all over? 😫"
Cheap material the last piece of wood broke trying to push into place disappointing considering I paid 150$ do not place anything on it as it seeps into the wood no drinks no plate nothing can be placed on it the fire place is super thin so it’s hollow in the back
"This unit is complete trash. Six of the holes were drilled incorrectly, causing me to have to hire someone to come and fix it. The back pieces do not lineup. The front edging piece which is poorly designed anyway also does not lineup. The heat from the fire unit has a range of about 18 inches after which you feel no heat at all. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"DO NOT PURCHASE UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO PUT TOGETHER. My box was damaged when I got it and put it in a storage unit until I moved in to my house after the 90 days not thinking I was going to get a damaged / missing pieces. Well reached out to Ameriwood and they sent replacement but I kept informing them it was not fitting right, Ameriwood told me to reach out to Walmart to get just a whole another replacement or refund of course I didn’t want a refund I just wanted them to replace it . After waiting on hold for Walmart determination if they will replace I was told they will not . So Becareful when you purchase and make sure your box is all together."
"Horrendous, directions are not specific at all. I’ve had to go through multiple times and undo work because the directions lead me astray. Multiple holes don’t match up making it impossible to put together correctly. And like everyone else, one of my pieces came chipped and had a random hole drilled through the varnished side of the wood???? Looks like they’re sending returned products out without checking them first. Don’t even waste your time."
"I really wanted to like this, but during assembly some of the screws were defective and snapped while being screwed into the wood! I reached out to there customer service 12/9/2022 and still have not gotten a solution from them after sending photos on multiple occasions and explaining what had happened. So now I am stuck with a side that will not be fully secured. Additionally the assembly was pretty bad nothing aligned probably."
"All the holes are mismatched due to which i wasted my 2 hrs, in the end i got to know the center panel holes are given on the wrong side due to which i cannot completely assemble the table, no proper delivery service, found it settled on the corner of road aswell so had to move it all by myself, if i had an option i would rate it in minus ranking"
"I was able to put it together by myself in a little over an hour. It would’ve been a lot easier with a second person, but it’s completely possible to do by yourself. It seems to be good quality and it looks great! The price is spectacular for what you get. Overall, highly satisfied."
Built the whole thing was about to put the shelves on just to realize number 5 bubble was completely empty and there were no parts for the shelves to go into place. Idk how to get ahold of Walmart and tell them there’s missing pieces and I’m annoyed
I'm a 58 year old woman and I was able to put this together with hardly any problems at all took me about 2 hours. I just love this the only thing I wish it had was a remote but you can't win all. the product was not damaged at all and it's absolutely beautiful I just love it!
"Before purchasing, I read both positive and negative reviews. I decided to take the risk. I regret that. The pre-drilled holes were not in the correct places to align with the screws. We followed the directions precisely and when we went to attach the last board, it completely fell apart. The screws ripped through all the boards. Don't waste your time."
You will definitely need someone assisting you while assembling this stand but it was so worth all the struggle at the end lol Me and my aunt put this together and we are no where near handy just follow all the instructions throughly and it should turn out perfectly
"Absolutely love this purchase. It looks amazing, the flame effect is so soothing, I sometimes forget it’s fake. My furnace was out for a couple days and this kept my apartment cozy warm. My only complaint is how lie it sits to the ground , but for 150.00 it is perfect!"
"Package arrived quickly and was in good shape. The box is heavy and I recommend at least 2 people to carry the box and assemble the fireplace. Instructions were decent and easy to follow. I didn't have any issues with the pieces or hardware needed to assemble. Toward the end of assembly I had some issues with getting some of the pieces to fit properly where the firebox goes, but I was able to force fit three of the pieces and all is good. I was a bit disappointed with the leading edge top piece as it doesn't quite sit evenly with the rest of the top piece and there is a ledge along the top, but this isn't a deal breaker for me. Overall it's a nice fireplace for the price."
"It’s easy to assemble, easy instructions, has more than enough nails, screws etc. looks and works great. Absolutely love this… had a nick on one corner as you can see in photos but I attribute that to shipping. Carriers / shipping  are not very gentle…."
I love my table just the right size for one person!
"Their. So
Much hate about this bar table and stool perfect for my little  kitchen. And I'm a single person I can set on them just fine and I'm a thick girl  with long legs  !! It worth for a apartments that has  small space"
"l was truly surprised, once assembled.  The set was attractive and sturdy.  Considering the low cost. Well, so far so good. Time will tell."
"I just love this little table. It's very lightweight and provides that extra space I need to food prep, baking etc. I love the colors and the design. I am really happy with it."
I love it it's very easyto assemble very sturdy just beautiful
Smaller than I thought it was going to be but works for our small space. I bought it for my kids to eat at
It's very comfy and cute
"on time, no shipping damage, easy assembly."
"Please pay attention to the dimensions. This is a high table with low stools. I'm 5 foot eight inches. When I sit down on one of the stools, the table top is high up on my chest, making it difficult to eat from a plate. Walmart sells a folding stool that is 24 inches for sixteen dollars. This works a lot better. One of the stools is very wobbly. Quality control is needed by the manufacturer. The screws are easy to strip out if overtightened. I used an awl to get the cushion screws started. One of the table legs came dented but still usable. It works for the price."
The stools are too small and low
I like the way we can keep the Stools under the table
horrible the table seats is cracked and  one of the legs is missing  they wont even give me back my money or reship never will i buy again
The top of the table was totally scratched up. I didn't have the box any more so I couldn't send it call. Totally disappointed
Super easy to put together and looks like it costs a lot more than it does. I like the size because it's not too big and it fits perfectly in the space I was hoping for.
"I love it and looks nice in my dinning room.  It was a little small so I order another one and I'm going to
push them together so it will  make a large table"
It wasn't all that hard to put together the stools are not that good only because there's any weight to really hold a person who is heavy but I just decided to buy some stool chairs and the table is small but anyway I like it
I purchased this for my sons small apartment kitchen. Im pleased with the attractive  table considering the cost and ease of attaching legs.  The stools are the only reason I deducted a star. Not sure how long they will last as they are not very sturdy.
this is perfect for the price
"Somewhat easy to build for me. Love how it fits and looks in my kitchen, ans still have soace to cook ans clean and move around."
"The table is a perfect size and fit and seems to be decent quality so far. However,  the stools are smaller than I thought they would be and are not that sturdy."
It's beautiful. Very sturdy. Didn't have any problems with assembly.
I own both versions of this stand. The other version of it allow for the tv to be floating. I used it in the non floating configuration which is why I bought this version as its the table top only version. This one is about $20 cheaper but its only sold online. The steel frame is a great look in contrast to the black tempered glass. Will hold up to a 65 inch tv with no problem.
I hate assembling things so that was challenging but otherwise it's beautiful!
Assembly took longer than expected. But very nice look!
"Fit my cassettes player, CD player, DVD players, AV receiver and DirecTV receiver. Center speaker sits on the middle of top shelf.
I used bottom hole for adjustable middle shelf, which makes
              8 3/4 in. space between bottom and middle shelf
              10 in. space between middle and top shelf"
"Very nice TV stand. Looks very sleek, and holds my 65"" TV perfectly.

The unit was easy to assemble...took about 30 minutes. The only ""downside"".....some of the suction cups will not go in to the pre-drilled holes, no matter what you do. The few that wouldn't insert, I just laid on the hole and placed the glass (carefully) on them. The weight of the glass will hold them in place.

All in all, a very nice TV stand at a great price."
"I bought a 55"" Flat Screen tv and needed a stand. and purchased this one online with Walrmart.  So I decided to share a mother and son time with my teenage boy.   Sure it took us about 3 hours, a fan on the side and many ""Ahh ama"" from my kid later  to put it together but he now feels confident he can built anything!! It is so sturdy and beautiful.  We love it!!!!"
"Good stylish tv stand but it arrived damaged, 1 silver panel is broken. I kept it because if is too heavy to handle and took an hour to put together. Would like to contact the seller for replacement of 1 panel or at least partial refund."
"A great stand, fits my 65” great but one of the glass tops shattered on delivery which I assume isn't Walmart's fault. I still was able to make it work though I just have a bottom and top shelf no middle. Would of got 5 stars if it weren't for that."
"The stand is beautiful on the box and in the store.  However, the person I hired to do the assembly had trouble with the pre-drilled hole on the right side did not accept/support the screws.  Tried to use an impact drill, the screws will not go in or hold. Tried several things to get the right side of the F Leg to hold.  On hold now for customer service."
I really like glass TV stands and I have a 65 inch its perfect. The glass is black so its nice a sleek looking
The TV stand looks good and is extremely sturdy. The price is reasonable. The only con I have is there is no baseless mount with hide a cord.
"Beautiful and solid three-shelf TV stand with tempered glass for 60"" flat panel TV. Can use the lower shelves for other electronic accessories or displaying your favorite and unique pieces."
"The box of the package it was shipped in arrived damaged. Probably because of Fedex handling it roughly. Disappointing, honestly."
I love that it was easy to put up
"Very strong, simple and very to assemble."
"It was so  easy to assemble 
I luv it"
"Beautiful and super sturdy!!
Love this TV stand!
Be sure to have some help cause your gonna need 4 to 6 extra hands.
Did it myself and as a woman 
Yes I wish I had the help
Other than very lovely..
Max time 30 to 60 mins to assemble 
Did have very tiny scratches but wasn't really noticable. Good for a medium to large room..Not a small room"
This stand looks good its a pain to put together for me anyway it is so pretty when finished but does not hold a 65 inch tv at least not the newer ones with the legs so I ended up putting my 50 inch in my den on it and buying a different stand for my 65 inch samsung.
I like the design and sturdiness of the stand. However I think the glass shelves for the boom and middle are cut to tight especially the bottom. It was extremely  hard getting the piece in. Also the suction cups are little too big for the holes but overall it's a good stand but can be improved and instructions  were easy to follow
"This set is very, very cute! It is smaller than I expected, but that makes it perfect for small spaces. I love the storage units. Not sure what other reviewers meant by not sturdy. It's very sturdy, in my opinion. I stored a, very heavy, glass mixing bowl with mixer set, in one of the cubes and a gaming system in another. Held up great! It's very easy to put together. Instructions recommend a two person set up, but I don't know why. I put it together by myself, and it took less than an hour. Overall cute set and I would definitely recommend for those in small spaces and/or for use as a table for youth. Stools would be great for storing their crayons, markers, crafts, etc."
"I love this table. It is slightly smaller than our last table which helps make room in our tiny kitchen for everyone to be able to sit., the storage option in the seats is actually the number one reason we bought it. We just have a lot of stuff and no counter space. So now we use the seats to store stuff in the kitchen. ."
Table set is really small but makes small kitchen seem roomy...a lil intimidating bcuz of all the pcs but it was put together fairly quickly once everything was matched up ....really heavy and gud quality
Little shorter than expected. All pressboard table. 2 pieces had chips in the seats. We used a black marker to fill in bc I didn’t want to pack it up and send it back. Bought this for my daughter who doesn’t have kids. It will work for what she needs but not sure I would but it for a family. Overall pretty happy with it but don’t see it being extremely durable for smaller kids.
"The ottomans get heavy depending on what you put in them. If you have cats, they love it, but the top of ottomans get messy fast. It's nice for small spaces on a budget. We do use it, but I am looking into wheels to put on the bottom of the chairs because they got heavy. Like, maybe the scooter they use at Garden Stores. Maybe that could work. Anyway, it works as advertised. The table is sturdy. The ottomans are, but because they get moved %26 opened a lot, they could deteriorate before the table ever would. May a few extra nails to hold for longer time."
"This is perfect for someone with a very limited amount of space. I love the extra storage and I can comfortably sit here with leg room. It’s a little wonky trying to pull out the chairs on carpet. It would be nice if there was a handle on the back of the chairs or something to help pull it out. For the price and quality, I’m happy."
I absolutely love the table but unfortunately some pieces are not in good condition. Some are scratched %26 some corners are completely missing the paint. There were also no cover ups for the nails
I've had it for all of two months and it's already falling apart. Big wood pieces falling all over my floor I'm really disappointed with the furniture I will not be buying anything else from Walmart furniture wise
Falls apart in less than a week. Holes drilled are too big cheap hardware breaks Walmart won’t do anything to rectify the headache this thing is. Top came off when I went to move onto rug stripped out now and worthless
It was only up for a week before it decided to fall apart on my kids then for you to return it for an replacement they expect you to keep a box and get another box for those big heavy pieces
"Set this up and really like it!  However, please note that the top is pretty hollow. I bought this as a homeschool table for my kiddos. Less than 24 hours of owning it, my kiddo set his school basket on it, and cracked the top. So just be gentle setting stuff on it."
Box was completely torn like someone tried to open it. One of the bottom liners for an ottoman was broken but the piece was not in the box. I think this was a return that was sent to me. Otherwise the piece is beautiful.
"This table set is for our fifth wheel camper and we love it. The color, texture and extra storage is just wonderful. So easy to put together and the compliments that we have gotten from our camping friends is unbelievable.
Love, Love it."
This is a dinette set so not a full size dining set but plenty big. Not a kids table as a lot of people are saying. Love it.   Only flaw is the storage. Not sturdy on the bottom so only very lightweight things can go in like extra blankets.
we live in a small NY apartment and this table is sturdy and small place worthy. We use the storage seats for snacks and rice and placemats.  It is family friendly and the seats are just right.
"Love how each piece was labelled so easy to put number 1 into number two etc. Storage in seat is a lot bigger than expected. Perfect table for two tiny tots to eat, do work and store their toys out of sight."
I was iffy at first but as soon as It was set up instantly loved it nice space savor holds up nice and adds some character to the room nobody I know yet has one so it is a plus thanks!!!!
This table fell apart and my grandson was hurt. During  our dinner I want to return it asap is the worst piece of furniture  I have ever bought.  I have already made payments  u can keep what I pd so far just want it picked up I do t have the shipping box. I never thought this would lose up and fall apart.
I liked the product but mine came damaged
"The quality of the materials are very poor ,screws and screw housings are falling off"
"Easy to put together, love all the options for stand up, drawers on either side etc."
"Assembly took 5 hours. 
Desk is well built. It assembled accurately."
Was assigned to work from home when the pandemic started and my already sedentary lifestyle was worse now that I did not have a stand to sit desk. Found this desk and loved how beautiful yet functional it was. I have been spoiled with having the luxury of an Lshaped desk and this hit all the marks. The assembly started rather tedious but after you get the hang of it it‚Äôs much easier. Very pleased.
I love this desk! I love how it looks and the sit to stand feature is great! I recommend it for a home office! Totally functional and doesn't take up a lot of space!
Great price and exactly as described!
The desk came on time and was easy to put together and I love it
"This desk is sturdy and attractive. The standing desk portion works well.  The drawers aren't as substantial as you would expect but the mechanisms work well. Set aside a solid 4 hours to assemble this desk. 

The one thing I really disliked is that the standing desk wing requires you to remove a piece of trim and several plastic caps that you just finished installing on the main desk. If the desk instructions had mentioned that as a possibility,  it would have saved me some unneeded aggravation as the plastic caps were very difficult to remove."
"Pros - love the sit-stand option and size of the desk (it's big, lots of countertop space!). Cons - feet are made of plastic and while they match the desk (ash grey color) they do look a little off and rather cheap. No tray for the keyboard, minimal drawers for storage and it is press-wood/laminate so not sure how long it will hold up. Overall, it's a nice deal for what I paid."
The desk looks great in my office and it is very functional. I love the stand up feature. It was shipped in two boxes. The directions are a bit tedious and took a couple hours to put together but it was well worth it. Great product and very happy with my purchase
Beautiful once together but soooo hard to put together. Directions are not the best. Took an 8 hr day to put together.
In great shape! Only one flaw on one chair. Perfect for a small family.
Good table overall. One of the chairs has a stain on it.
The table is beautiful but im not sure if the chairs are supposed to lean forward like it does. It makes it uncomfortable to sit in
Missing a piece to the top of chair.  Tight fit if 4 people were eating. Not too bad for the price.
This table is a piece of crap literally havent had for a month and not one but two chairs have broke at half at the bottom there flimsy im very disappointed
the wood top was damaged.
everything was damaged and broke before I opened it and was a day late and now late picking back up to return
"don't bother buying, save for a better set everyone of these chairs have fell apart not to the point where you can fix unless you have a welding set. now I ordered this 6 weeks ago probably had it for 5 all chairs broke and table peeling waste of moneyyyy"
"Paid $159.99 for a table that is defective. The holes that were bored out for the bolts, were not bored out enough. When I tightened the bolts the pressure of the bolts cause the bolts to come through. Will not recommend this product."
"My package arrived dented and smashed. Upon opening it, I was quite surprised at how the pieces went together, or should I say didn't go together? I built two chairs on a Friday while at work (for the break room), and when I arrived Monday morning to continue the assembling, I noticed that there was rust dust EVERYWHERE. The chair I had assembled had chipping paint and was rusting. I tried to initiate the return with Walmart, but they referred me to Costway. Being in a foreign country, the emails were sporadic and challenging to comprehend. The customer service rep negotiated with me over several days, offering me various amounts of money to compensate me for the trouble. I paid $120 and she offered me $40. When I refused, she offered me $7..."
Love it ! The seats are so soft ! And got delivered super fast
Very high quality materials. I expected the metal legs and wood to be more flimsy but I was pleasantly surprised to see that everything was very sturdy. Overall great experience for the price.
I gave this one star but if I could I would give it a zero. First night using this set and the seat on two of the chairs broke. I do not recommend purchasing this item.
"The assembly information was not great, but you can make it work. The screws and the holes don't always align, and require quite some maneuvering. Due to this, the assembly takes quite some time, but in the end, you get what you pay for. It's not ""amazing"" great, but is acceptable for a small dining room. Doesn't feel very sturdy either and with screws not tightening all the way through, there's a constant fear of it breaking under your weight. The chairs are average size and don't always feel comfortable, especially if you're someone taller and /or broader. The table is smaller than I mentally pictured it. So far, it's okay. I'll update, it it ever breaks (hope that never happens)! :D"
"Being as meticulous as I am it took several hours to assemble, however it's worth it to take the time in making it sturdy. Some of the screws are super hard to get in all the way, especially with the little tool they give you to screw them in. However, with extreme patience and a few sweat and tears, it can be a nice little set for your apartment. I especially love the swirly black accents on the table and chairs, it makes it look fancier and more expensive than it actually is lol."
"Table is better than the chairs. I brought this same item in a different location but it is  exactly the same. Three of the chairs did not survive the first six months and I had to replace the chairs through target which those two sucked also. I still have one chair from the original set that I use in my hallway. The table however has lasted through the years. I've had it for about eight years. It has lasted five children. Teeth markings,  pencil stabbings, scribbling and drill hole when fixing a screw. I wish I could buy the table without the chairs."
the whole set is beautiful but for the price is too small and onen of the chairs at  the top is dubbed
"Assembled as soon as it arrived but the instructions that came with it was somewhat unclear. Tightened the bolts on chairs and they feel somewhat sturdy. 
The set looks very pleasing outside our covered outdoor patio."
delivered. no instructions on how to put it together.  no parts list. i don't know how to put it together.
came when promised and there was no damage to the shipment. was looking a while for dining set like this and was able to put together with help though it took roughly an hour to an hour and a half
This was so worth it !! I paid for set up and it was the best decision ever. The person was great and communicated awesome .
"Everything about this set is beautiful.  Looks durable, the acacia wood is solid and the chairs are sturdy.  I think its beautiful.  The instructions are good and pretty helpful.  The instructions state you will need a hammer but it doesnt say where. I figured it out. You will need to use it to make the legs fit into each other.  If you decide on getting this set, you will most definitely need to use some strength putting the chairs together.  There were times where my husband and I couldnt align the holes of chair pieces.  On the instructions it says not to tighten the bolts completely until all the holes are aligned and  have the bolts in just 50%.  That is so true and Im glad they tell you.  Aside from that, it was totally worth the few ..."
The set was delivered quite quickly.  It was packaged well with no damage.  The directions were clear and I had no issued putting the set together.  The chairs and table are sturdy with no wobble.  The complete set looks beautiful!  My wife is happy and the guests have complimented  the set.  They are surprised at the look and quality for a Walmart item.
love everything about this table and chair it fit well in my patio. the begining of great BBQs!
I am missing one of the bottom legs part to one of the chairs it is a beautiful set but would love to get a replacement piece for the chair. The set is absolutely stunning and very comfortable. I am extremely pleased beside the fact it is missing one piece from the bottom of the chair.
Cheap quality. 8 pieces arrived with wicker coming off.  Seller is making it hard to return. And they want me to find a local person to glue it back together?!?
We have tried to contact the seller and even Walmart.com customer service and no solution to the parts that came broken. Table has several parts with loose wicker and also 4 of the chairs panels. Wood on the table has no holes to install the screws and is completely loose.  We have provided photos and no response. It has been very disappointed with the customer service from Walmart and Costway. The furniture is completed not worth the price.
DO NOT BUY!!! The screw inserts just spin around so you can't tighten it and the table is WOBBLY!!! The company will give you a run around because they don't want you to return it!!!! That's is what they are doing to me right now!
"Purchased this for our backyard. Customer service was terrible. It came in 4 boxes, one was several days late. Half were sent with ups and half w fedex and Walmart only had tracking numbers for the fedex pieces, so they kept telling me it was delivered when it obviously was not. Told me to contact the manufacturer to find it, they had 90 minute wait time on calls. Missing box showed up several days late. One of the more difficult pieces of furniture we have ever assembled, rattan already cracked and broken in several places when we got it out of the box, the metal frame not machined well. I had to bang down corners with a hammer and grease everything up w olive oil to assemble the table. Finish on the wooden arms already worn looking. Absol..."
"This is sold through Costway, not Walmart. Walmart is just the distributor. The same item is for sale at Wayfair for $50 more- I should have done that. Shipping was a NIGHTMARE. I ordered this before family came in from out of state and tried to give myself a two-week window between when it said shipping was and their arrival. Half the chairs were never shipped out. I emailed multiple times and was met with an ""okay. We will ship again, wait a few weeks"". No, that doesn't work for me. I need them by a specific date. A few days late, I could understand, but they came THREE WEEKS later than everything else. Costway then said they would refund me $30 for my issues which never showed up. 

The quality is alright. It is definitely not something ..."
Appears to be a returned item not very well cleaned up
Too expensive to only look good for a few months!
set up wasn't terrible. love the adjustable chair legs. it's a beautiful set
"Extremely difficult to put together,  the holes are in the wrong spots, we had to bang it with a mallette to fit.  No care in craftmanship at all, the wicker doesn't line up.  I have treated the table top twice alright in my 1 month of having it and its already fading.  
I was shipped in 4 boxes... 2 boxes were shipped to someone elses house, they opened it.  No apology from the company, they just sent me the broken opened boxes.  I do not recommend this product!"
"Once this is put together, it is a substantial weather resistant set.  We are in a very windy area but table doesn't move even with high winds.  The chairs have a nice touch with the wooden arm rests. we ended up moving 2 of the chairs and making another seating area with a little table.  The wooden top of the table may need to be oiled eventually."
For $1000 I expected much more! This was such a pain to put together. The holes don't line up exactly with the chairs it took lots of muscle getting this together. Spending this type of money expected more clear and concise directions. If you're not handy don't dare attempt this at all you will end up super frustrated! I was going to return it but I have company coming this weekend and need to use it!
We love the way ours looks but the table could be a few inches longer. The seats fit just perfectly under so there really is no wiggle room. Recommend using this table for six at most and using the other two chairs elsewhere in your outdoor space. Pretty easy to put together once you get in the rhythm. They give you a small torque wrench which is pretty necessary for the chairs especially.
Very hard to buy an outdoor set online. Set is much smaller than it looks in the picture especially the seats. Seats are much harder to put together as holes don't lineup N they are wobbly as the bottoms also don't lineup. Unfortunately by the time we put the set together I am past the return policy so I am stuck with the set which is not cheap.
"I spent hours looking for a new patio dining set that would seat 6. Everything I found had such small tables, and I knew I wouldn't be satisfied. Finally I googled 80 inch patio dining and was surprised when I found this set at Walmart. I would never have thought to look on their website for something like this. It actually has seating for 8, although I think 6 would be most comfortable for everyone. The set arrived in a matter of days. (One note, I had a bit of confusion because two of the boxes were shipped by UPS and two were shipped by FedEx arriving a day later.)  I hired a handyman to assemble the set, and it took him about 4 hours. The set is beautiful, and the chairs are very comfortable. I can't wait to have my friends over for din..."
"The set looks very pretty but I am not sure how long will it survive. In addition, it's so difficult to assemble the chairs, the holes are not aligned at all, it's taking a toll on my husband. It takes 1.5 to 2 hrs to assemble 1 chair, we still have 6 more to go and so fed up with it. The paint is chipping off in some places where the cane is not visible. Just want to get done with this set."
"Okay, I'm a disabled veteran, and I'm stuck in a wheelchair on a daily basis.  FedEx delivered my package DAYS early, which was great, and brought the box into my apartment, for me.  I sat there and tried to figure out how I was going to assemble this dinette set, and thought ""THIS is going to be complicated.""  I opened the box, got out my battery powered drill, and my set of Hexagon drill bits.  
IT WAS NOT HARD FOR ME TO PUT THIS TOGETHER!!  The only thing I needed was for my son in law to come over and help with the table.  I had the chairs assembled within 45 minutes, and my son in law has the table together in about 15-20 minutes.
It's a really nice dinette set, and my power chair fits underneath the table nicely.  Which means I can ro..."
I just got a new apartment and I did not really have any furniture and was working on a budget. For the size of my dining room this was perfect for the price it was perfect I do notice that there is a bit of a dent in the world due to shipping so make sure that if you buy there such you check it out it was a little too late for me because I ordered a lot of stuff and didn't move for another month or so I didn't check it. It is functional and it works especially if you've got a smaller apartment or if you just want an extra seating area for your den or something. I like it more than I thought I would
It is a good size for a small apartment. And the only thing that I dislike that Walmart does not offer assembly even if we have to pay for it
Good value for the price
"Love this table set! Very cute. Perfect size for my apartment kitchen. Was able to put together by myself. Decent construction but would not recommend to family with smaller children, not sturdy enough to withstand that kind of wear and tear. Perfect for me tho!! Very happy with it."
"the one thing i did like about this is the color, it goes well eith my kitchen, so far the chairs have held up pretty well, and i weigh about 230lbs, the screws in the table and chairs will back out over time so i suggest using good loc tite like i ended up doing, the vinyl wrap on the table and chairs cleans up easy but also scratches easy so be careful, also you might want to pull the plastic ends from the feet and tips of the chairs and table and glue them on,,other than that ive had no issues with it."
no cushions for chairs.i thought yhere would be cushions like the model in walmart. not to my pleasing cheep set should have bought it in store. now going to cost me more money. your pictures on line do not show close up.
i am missing a screw to the chair to put it together
Wobbly breaks easy and gets dirty very easily also chairs are uneven
"Takes many hours to put together, and I'm usually someone who puts together furniture pretty easily.

Table came cracked on two corners. Since this is listed from a third party seller on Walmart, I've had to coordinate with a pretty difficult customer service rep over getting a refund. 

After some back and forth they offered me a 50% refund over a product that came damaged. 

Might have been a shipping issue, but does not seem worth it to purchase this product if you're going to need to dedicate multiple hours putting it together and haggling with customer service reps over getting your money back."
"it's good simple and easy to assemble if you need a little table set and the price is right,this is it."
"It’s easy to assemble, however the table and chairs are not very sturdy at all. We have had the set for only a few months and the legs on all of the chairs have bent. The finish on the table started coming up a few weeks after we got the set as well."
Very nice and easy to put toghter
Very nice set . Perfect size .
great for looking at. Too fragile and tiny for actual eating at. Kids would break it in minutes.
Not sturdy at all. Super wobbly no matter how tight or lose the screws are put in.
Arrived broken. Returning and not repurchasing this piece of garbage.
Easy to assemble looks great
"Perfect for what we were looking for, easily put together and fits perfectly into our kitchen."
"I am satisfied with 5 piece dining table set. The appearance of the table and chairs are beautiful. Last sunday,my friends had dinner in our dining. They said the table is beautiful and they felt happy. Besides,the table and chairs look sturdy."
"Absolutely stunning. Great way to add character on a budget.  Good quality. As per usual, not all the pieces were labeled. But my daughter put it together on her own pretty quickly you"
"Absolutely love my new cabinet. The directions are excellent, with no problems. I assembled it myself and at my age, I guess I'm considered a ""senior"".  64 years young woman.  I hope in the future you will come out with a similar cabinet that has two doors, to hide the contents inside.  I would purchase again. Love the color. Very heavy, durable product.  I would give 6 stars if I could."
"Absolutely love this piece! Arrived before the scheduled date. Already bought 3 pieces from this collection and I can't wait to buy more. Everyone that has seen it, loves it ! Im super happy with this piece and the others. Im fiance put it together and it didn't seem difficult at all. Took him about 2.5 hours to build. I highly recommend!"
"Absolutely love this!  Great for a pantry, especially if you dont have one in your house.  Easy to put together.  Can move around the shelves for your needs."
"We took our time putting this cabinet together, everything squared up and we couldn't be happier!  looks great and add so much character to the room."
i put this together myself. very easy to follow instructions. i loved the matching tv stand so much i had to get the matching cabinet.
"The bookcase was as expected, but the assembly was not good.  Initially, I thought the assembly looked good, but after review,  I have spent a few hours trying to repair what was done, but there are holes where there shouldn't be, the door won't stay on the track. I paid $65 for the assembly, and it took over 3 hours for the hired assembler to complete.  I'm not going to rate the product bad."
"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this piece! I get compliments from everyone who sees it. Exactly what I was looking for and fits perfectly in any room's decor. 
The ONLY thing I will warn about ... check and double check ALL pieces BEFORE starting to put it together.  We ended up having one cracked shelf and one broken trim board for the door.  When I contacted walmart help center, they are not able to send replacement parts.  My only options were to return the entire unit for replacement or refund.  The unit was already assembled and in use. So they did offer me a small discount refund to fix the pieces myself.  
Even with these issues, I would still highly recommend this piece.  It is a beautiful piece with ample storage."
"We bought this for our back hallway to store items the family needs that do not already hang on a hook or belong on a shoe rack. The instructions were clear and there were no pieces missing. However, a shelf did arrive damaged. Rather than go through the headache of requesting another shelf, we simply opted not to install it. 
Considerable force was required to install the shelves after the unit had been put together, but that was possible without damage being done. We figured the “tightness” only added to the overall stability of the piece. It still feels like a “cheap” piece of furniture: the barn door rattles on the track, one of the door hangars is attached crookedly because the pre-drilled holes are crooked. But it does the job well, a..."
"First shelf came out beautifully. I really like the shelf so I ordered again. However, this time some of the parts didn't line up so shelf couldn't get finished. I paid for assembly assistant too. Very disappointed..."
"It is heavy but was easy to set up. Had delivered so we carried piece by piece in and laid out according to instructions. This is second one we have purchased to finish living room and looks great!!! Also we got the tv cabinet also and piece was broken, company was so helpful and replace broken part within days!!!"
"First the bad, the box was probably one of the heaviest boxes I've had to move so two people would be very beneficial to move the box inside to the place of assembly. Having said that, it's a very nice looking piece and a good value for the money. Save yourself some headaches and download the Built app, which gives you step-by-step verbal and visual directions for assembly. It still took a while to put together but once finished, it met our expectations. We bought two of them to put side-by-side so that the doors would appear as if they were closing together and opening apart from one another. The one thing we didn't realize beforehand is that in order for that to work, one door has to be flipped upside down with the track brackets attached..."
"This is an absolutely gorgeous and solid cabinet, IF PUT TOGETHER CORRECTLY. It has hidden cams throughout that must be tightened correctly to ensure a solid build. Follow the directions very carefully, and double check as you go. I'm a single mom with no experience, and it was a tedious but not difficult build. At the end, there are instructions to make adjustments if your door doesn't line up perfectly. If any parts are missing or broken, contact the company (Sauder) and they will replace them at no charge! (I had a broken shelf front, missing cams, and bent glide bar). Although time consuming to put together, I'm very pleased and wouldn't hesitate to purchase again!"
"Took a while to put together but wasn't horrible. Starting putting the shelves in, one of the shelves peeled the “paper” off and the other shelf was so tight, it cracked the wall. Very upsetting!!! Such a beautiful piece that I LOVE but it's messed up now."
"I bought two of these, as well as the glendale desk.  They matched perfectly.  They store a lot and they are very heavy-duty (and heavy).  My husband and I were very impressed.  They have the look and feel of real wood.  I used cardboard under the legs to move them around, and we didn't put the leg ""caps"" on the bottom of the legs because we didn't think we needed them."
"This is an amazing cabinet! It is easy to put together, the directions are easy to read and follow and simple to put this cabinet together. The cabinet is sturdy, the wooden pieces are are amazing look in the living where it exist and I love the door and hinge that allows it move freely back and forth. Would recommend this piece to anyone."
"I was so excited to get this! As soon as it was delivered I ripped it open and started building. While putting it together I found 3 broken boards and the rod that the door slides on is bent. Wasn't worth returning since it was pretty much put together and I'm sure the replacement would have the same issues. The flaws are only noticeable up close, but it wasn't worth the 230$."
"We trulu love the look of this cabinet. We needed a pantry in our kitchen, it works great. Assembly is another story. Not only was it time consuming,  5 hours to assemble, but the measurements were off, and 3 of the 6 shelves did not fit. We had to cut off a 1/4 inch so the shelves could slide in."
I love this cabinet! I love the color and how it looks in my home. I would've given 5 stars but for some reason it's crooked a bit no matter what we do. My husband spent hours trying to straighten and it still won't straighten. I'm sure it's something dumb we missed somehow. but how cute does it look?! I love.
"We were so excited to get our cabinet. It was shipped by FedEx and was a few days late. (Walmart never notified us.) When it arrived it was in a long, thick sheet of plastic and the parts weren't fully covered by cardboard. Welp, now we know this piece arrived damaged. We added the Handy building service, and they did their best to construct despite the damage. But wood glue may not be able to save the cracked door and dented metal slide. Very disappointed in the shipping process and the quality. Stay away from this one!"
The generous size cubes are great to store extra clothing and the open shelves store books and collections my son wanted to display in his room. I am a single mom so having this delivers to my door was a huge help!!
I love these Better Home and Gardens cube organizers.  I have purchased 4 in the last year.  I also have some from other brands and I like this best for the quality and price.. I even have a wooden one by John Louis Home and this one is pretty almost just as nice.  Target sells little boot trays that fit in the cubicles so I have those on the bottom cubes. Works out pretty well!
They are affordable; easy to put together; a quality product; and look great in my office/craft room!  Better Homes makes a quality product and I am so glad I purchased these!
"Very nice 9cube storage organizer. It arrived quickly and all the pieces were intact. There was a couple small scuffs on one of the large boards but it's on the bottom so no one will ever see it. It was relatively easy to put together. I did it by myself in a little over an hour. I love how big it is! Im So happy I spent the extra money and bought the one with the 13inch cubes instead of the 11inch cubes. Even tho this one was almost twice the price. It looks so much nicer and sturdier and it can hold a lot more stuff. Now I just need to figure out where to put it. lol
INSTRUCTION TIPS: Step 4 says to attach all of the partition boards to the shelves with the dowels. But instead just attach the shelves to the 2 middle partition boards and l..."
"I have been waiting and waiting to get another shelf and finally I see these come into stock and then finally the color options appeared.  I checked right away to see that the Rustic Gray is really the Rustic Gray from before because the new picture is a light colored natural wood.  IT IS THE SAME COLOR  as before thankfully.  My husband put it together and said it was exactly the same as before.  The main difference I notice was that the finish is not smooth like before.  The other shelf feels super smooth and this is fairly textured and a rougher feel.  I would prefer the smoother one but not a huge deal. I am just pleased to get a matching colored shelf.  Also, the old ones inside the cubes were about 13 x 13 and this one is wider by abo..."
"These shelves are amazing!! I bought 15 of them to creat a craft room in some bonus space in our home. They are easy to put together and the finish looks like painted wood. Once we got going, it only took about 20 minutes to put one together. We didn't have any missing hardware and there were no finish issues on ANY of the pieces, and that is out of 15 total kits! The shelves are weighty and sturdy. I was worried that I had paid too much, but they are worth every penny I spent!"
"I love this cabinet.  I got two 9-cube units since I read they were sturdier than a big unit.  (And I can separate them later if I want.). I put it together by myself except for getting the last two pieces on-when I needed one of my kids to push the piece while I screwed it together.  Great piece, especially for the price!"
The Natural color isn't as pictured. Its more of a rustic brownish grey. Not like the lite oak thats pictured. I also ordered two of the 16 cubes in the same color to go in the same room. I at least hope its the same color as this one! But it is sturdy. This is the third piece Ive bought. Just wish it was closer to the color pictured.
"I have a dozen of these cube organizers all through my house and never had an issue. Bought another for the playroom and the quality is so much different then previous ones. They have replaced the wooden dowels with thin cheap plastic ones and none of the holes line up. It took forever to put together trying to get the screws in the holes and there was so much tension on the screws and dowels. The dowels started to bend and pulled through the thin shelves and when we finally set it upright, the chip board pulled away from the veneer and the unit disintegrated. Price keeps increasing but the quality goes down. At least Walmart had helpful customer service!"
"I had purchase BGH six cube in 2019, very solid and good quality. This IS NOT the same quality. They now use plastic pegs instead of wooden and the boards are thinner and more particle board than wood. When put together, the whole thing wobbles which is ridiculous for a large piece of furniture. Even if you have been a BHG purchaser in the past, do not think this is the same thing. Also, tried to talk to customer service and kept trying to say it was shipping. They truly don’t care they are selling these cheap products at a large cost."
"When I got it the box looked fine. Started putting it together and many boards were scratched, chipped and what looked like the laminate on top was water damaged or wasn’t applied right. Was not happy. Ended up using a bracket to hold one shelf up due to the peg hole for the shelf was chipped out. Was able to hide the big scratches inside the cubby holes with the cubes."
"For the price I love it! It is not super high quality but it is a sturdy piece of furniture. It took my husband 30 minutes to put together, super easy. Offers lots of storage for toys. Paired with woven baskets (sold separately)."
We have bookcases from BHG that match the cube storage.  Looks great with the coordinating units.  Easy one person job to put together and install.
Very sturdy and tall! We love them!!! Sing as a dresser- I got 2 of them and worth every penny. Not hard to assemble.
I use as a dresser because it takes up less space and holds so much more. Instructions are very clear with picture drawings and easy to understand/follow.  Besides a screwdriver no extra tools needed.
"The white finish color is not white but almost a white wash and does not match my other white white cubes. The white finish started to come off during assembly. Also, it is slightly smaller than the cubes I purchased a year ago, see photo."
Easy to assemble and instructions were understandable.  The only thing I wish it could have offered was some kind of back covers.  This way small items do not fall behind your cubicle unit and forcing you to move it around to get the fallen items.
"I like the unit itself BUT - you will not get the color you think you're ordering! Color is completely inaccurate online. So beware, its a mixed bag - don't be set on a certain color because whatever you like online is not what you'll end up with."
Rustic gray is nowhere close to the color that is shown online.   It is a lot darker with green undertones. I will be returning this one and ordering the natural color. Hopefully it is closer to what I am looking for.
"I love it,  it does have the hook for the wall, however I will not use that. I use it for m Coffee stuff"
"I have used it multiple times every day since it arrived. This thing can do so many things. I bought it for its ability to grind things into powder. I was interested in making coconut flour and cassava flour where the ability to grind becomes necessary. Perfect for shakes and smoothies. It is sturdy and well made. It is very easy to use, to clean and comes with a large and small cup. I am really happy with this product and recommend it."
"Well packed in the box arrived earlier than usual, great product for the price got it for Some one as a gift"
"I haven’t had any problems so far, just brought it the 18th and it came on the 20th came home from work and made my baby some food and I love it, it’s very simple to use."
This is the best mini blender.
Love how small and easy to use it is. Wish it came with an extra tall cup not the little cup. I mAke smoothies every morning in this blender.
If you are looking for something compact it is the best blender. You can make smoothies and shakes in the big jar and smaller one is good for making sauces and puree. It does make some noise but overall worth buying.
"Sometimes it acts like its overheating and about to turn off. I said i was gonna exchange it for another, but over all its does the job
 I need my smoothies every day."
The motor head can not be replaced. The motor base plate is made of cheap plastic and will run out and won't work anymore and have to replace the whole thing
"I PURCHASED THIS BLENER ON WALMART WEBSITE AND WENT TO THE STORE TO PICK IT UP, ARRIVING HOME I COULD NOTICE THAT THE BLENDER WAS DIRTY INSIDE, THE CUP WAS WET AS IF SOMEONE HAS WASHED IT AND IT HAS STILL NOT DRIED AND FOR MY BIGGEST SURPRISE.  THE BLENDER WAS NOT WORKING AT ALL.  SINCERELY, I WILL NOT LOSE MY TIME COMMING BACK  TO THE STORE TO RETURN THE ITEM, I SIMPLY THROWED IT IN THE GARBAGE, BUT THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND DISRESPECTFUL ."
"This was my second magic bullet. I bought it on January and in just three months is not working properly. In the last three weeks started to make a terrible noise and when is adjusted and functioning smells like rubber. I think that the internal system is too strong compared with the lack of quality of the slicer and its components. Unfortunately, I can return it, but at least the manufacturer should replace the slicer."
"I ordered it online so it was quite a bit smaller than I expected. Not only that but I have only been able to make one smoothie successfully and I followed the instructions.  Not for someone who is used to making large amounts.  For individuals who don't treat shakes like a meal or don't mind it being small, great! Just definitely not for me."
Horrible experience!! I used it to blend fruits and veggies for my baby and it all came put little brown. Realised obly after a week when we didn't wash the blender right away that it was leaking some black tar looking material. Apparently the rubber is bad quality which was leaking in the food everytime we used the blender. My baby was puking throughout the week and we had the horrible realization at the end of the reason why. They should be sued for producing poor quality of material which is also used for food for babies. Pathetic!!
Works well for minimalist life style changes. Wish it came with A pulp strainer.
I love the fact I  can make my smoothies on my way out the door.
Best for the buck!!!! Grind things into a powder too. Could have improved on packaging though
excellent quality and i arrive early i am in love with this machine
All good and does what is intended to fo do easy use
"Love my new rice cooker, price is great, cooks rice quick, no mess. I should of bought it a long time ago."
the best better than regular pots makes my basta and boiled my eggs in less time .love it great little Crock-Pot
I like this product because I cooked rice and Quinua together and the texture was perfect like my photo. I recommend this product .
"I found this ""rice"" cooker on clearance for $18.00 several months ago. I live in my car, traveling full time, and I like to eat healthy food, not fast food. I have a Jackery Explorer 1000 power station in the car. I've plugged this little pot in and  
 cooked scrambled eggs and pancakes, a meal of turkey breast, mashed potatoes and green beans (all at once in the pot with the green beans in the steamer top.) I've also cooked pasta dishes and complete rice dishes including chicken thighs in this little pot. I even made TOAST in it! I use it to quickly boil water for chocolate or coffee. This is a most excellent and efficient little ""stove"" if you ask me. A typical full meal usually takes 20 minutes to cook."
"For the price, great option. Watched YT video reviews, and i have to agree, good purchase choice."
Perfect size looking forward to using this tonight
This is an excellent rice cooker. Keep it simple - this is all you need for perfect rice. My only complaint is that it came with an outdated coupon.
"I use this rice cooker, a half a dozen times, and the nonstick surface started to release from the bottom of the bowl, I contacted the manufacture, and they said it was normal wear and tear. I don’t feel that using a rice cooker six times and having the nonstick surface release into your food is normal wear and tear, I only used the wooden spoon on this I strongly suggest you look for a different brand. This is not a company that stands behind their product even though they have a one-year warranty."
"I bought this for my husband for our anniversary because he’s been wanting one. The first time he used it, it lit on fire. We were lucky enough to unplug it before it completely went up in flames. Unfortunately it was too late to return it, but I thought that others should know."
"For the low low price of $20 this rice cooker can't be beat. There is a larger version for those of you who need to cook more rice for an entire family but for those of you who only need to cook for one or two people this rice maker is perfect and will make one cup of rice at a time perfectly. I'm the type of person who knows how to cook and knows how to bake but I have trouble getting my rice perfect. 
The logic of these rice cookers is simple: Turn it on, it will boil the water until the water boils out. This will not only cook the rice, but will steam it. I have been testing this rice cooker with basmati rice, and every single cook comes out perfectly. If I had a large family, I would definitely consider buying the larger version of this..."
"I already had one for years and wanted another but something isn't right. Once it's on warm it starts to smoke like it's burning.  I went ahead and cooked some rice, no smoking, worked fine, but once it went back on warm it smoked up again like plastic is burning."
I love this little rice cooker. I live alone and this little pot cooks rice perfectly.  I had heard stories of gooey rice cooked in rice cookers and was expecting something like that but the rice was perfect. I have noticed that a small amount more of water cooks the rice softer without making it mushy. I would buy this product again.
I love my little rice cooker. There's only one person in this household and I am Asian so it works out great! Two cups for two people eating probably wouldn't be enough especially if they wanted heavy seconds. So you would need to use three cups of the rice. I love this little thing!
Lasted 3 months. Worked wonderfully the 6 times I used it. On the 7th attempt it was completely dead. If you’re wanting something to use a few times and throw away this will suffice.
"I read several reviews on this product before I purchased it. I was actually going to purchase the Black and Decker rice cooker/steamer, but I decided on this one. ( I didn't want to cook way too much rice. I just wanted to make sure I didn't have to cook rice every day.) I think most of the reviews that were bad, more specifically ""boil overs"",  were related to too much water or the rice was not rinsed before cooking. Starch in the rice is what makes it look like it's boiling over or foaming up while cooking in a regular pot so it would make sense that the same would happen in a rice cooker if the rice is not rinsed before it is cooked. I am such a stickler for following directions when using products like this, that I followed the directi..."
"This is my 2nd time trying a rice cooker. The firstone, I didnt have much success. With this brand, I was surprised at how fast the white rice  cooked (20mins). One tip I was given, is to thoroughly rinse your rice until the water is clear, to avoid any overspills. I pushed the button down to cook and finished watching TV. Before I knew it, rice was done! Took a previous reviewer's tip and unplugged it however, to avoid burning of the food. Will add a tad more water on next go 'round to have it cook just a little more. Other than that, it works for me!"
"After following directions exactly and turning it on, hot water spewed out of the vent and from around the sides of the lid. So much water came out that I had use a towel around the bottom of the cooker. Consequently so much water was lost that the rice was clumped and sticky. I threw it out. I absolutely would not recommend this rice cooker. I will have to purchase another brand."
"Keep your receipt!!! These do not last long, but they are cheap.  Expect a year at best with daily use. This particular one lasted about 6 weeks.  Not too difficult to get a replacement from the manufacturer which gets you an extra bowl and lid so you are motivated to just buy another one in a year.  The commercial aroma rice cookers last much much longer.  Well worth the price here.  Makes Great Rice."
"simply was looking for a cheap cooker and never had a rice cooker til this one. it is fantastic. simple, add rice, add the needed measurement of water. plug her in and push the tab down let it cook til ya hear the tab pop. done perfectly cooked. great buy for how cheap."
"As a proud new homeowner, I was looking for a blender that looked nice and matched my appliances. For our needs, this blender is a perfect fit! I haven't had it that long but from what I've seen it's made well and works great. My fiancé and I used it to make strawberry daiquiris. I was really impressed by the pulse feature. It blended the ice and frozen strawberries perfectly with the pulse button by moving the ingredients around without any additional help. Then we added some frozen mango with the same great results. The touch screen feature is great and makes for an easy clean. This blender is working great for us. Hope you're as happy with it as we are!"
"I didn't really think I was in the market for a blender, since I was using my mini blender/bullet. The problem with the bullet is that it is very limited in size and I noticed that things were getting stuck at the top of the cup (especially frozen fruit), not blending in with the rest of my smoothie. So, I decided to get a blender. I picked the Beautiful High Performance Touchscreen Blender at Walmart. First, it is so easy a first grader could use it. The buttons/functions light up. You choose the one you want, and the ingredients are blended in a flash. My morning smoothie is quick and easy, not to mention no annoying lumps are seeds in the mix. As for cleaning, that is also quick and easy. The blender is light and easy to lift as well as ..."
"This Beautiful blender will not disappoint! I have use it to make myself a slushee coffee and at first I used the smoothie option and it gave me perfect ice slivers. My next time I used purée and the ice was so fluffy and perfect! I love the digital display, no buttons to clean. The cup at the top fits perfect on the base. Make the buy! Treat yourself!"
"Beautiful… truly. Love the sleek, modern design. Works better than any other brand and the size of the jar is perfect for smoothies, mixing cocktails or simply chopping and blending other veggies. It's digital so it gives my kitchen the most modern look and feel plus this blue color looks very classy and matches perfectly with my stainless steel appliances. I give this a 10  all around"
This is my new favorite kitchen gadget! I love the sleek design and look. With it being all digital I like that the “buttons” are hidden until you need to use it. It definitely goes well with my very modern look I have going on in my kitchen. It works great as well! All the functions work just as you need them to and clean up is a breeze! Best new kitchen gadget so far!
"This is my first Touch Activated Blender and I like it! I decided to try a coffee smoothie and it turned out perfect. Directions were simple for the appliance and I really liked “no buttons” on a blender, just a touch screen. Clean up was easy too. Not too big of an appliance to fit on my counter top either."
"So far this has been a great little blender for my morning smoothies. I love the white and gold!

However, I, like other reviewers, was disappointed in the warning label in black letters on the front of the machine which was not visible in the shopping link images. However, I dabbed a little acetone on a cotton round and successfully removed the letters with no damage to my machine. 

I would have given 5 stars had the images not been deceiving."
"I didn't expect that this blender would be able to keep up with the old vitamix one I had. This is powerful. I have made smoothies, chopped ice, cleaning function. I love it. It is pretty with the gold trim on handle and it's slim. But the touch buttons I dont like, if my hands are wet or if I'm multitasking, the buttons don't respond. You have to press hard and sometimes multiple times before the machine turns on. The cord is short. I mean ridiculously short. At this point companies know you have multiple items on your counter. Why the short cord. Its only about 12 inches. And some of that is used to come around the blender. I had to shuffle things around and put this in the very front of my outlet. Away from the sink, so now I have water ..."
"I am so sad to write this, because I wanted to love this so much since I love Drew… but I haven’t even had this a year yet (and I have maybe used it less that 50 times…) and something inside broke and shot out a metal nut from inside the machine!! It also made an awful sound… and honestly it’s never really worked well… I am so sad and disappointed, and Walmart won’t let me return it. Ugh.."
"Don't waste your money!!  This is not a deal! Absolutely garbage. So finicky, have to use your strength to hold it down on the base or jumps off. Worked about two weeks and now it's just making a terrible metal on metal grinding noise but won't turn. I included a photo that shows metal shavings in the bottom. Even though the base fits together fine, it keeps grinding and won't spin the blades."
"A blender is one of those small kitchen appliances that is absolutely essential to a kitchen. I make fruit smoothies every day for breakfast and need a good blender. It's important to me that a blender is slim in size yet powerful in blending. After making frozen margaritas, frozen fruit smoothies, and a few other concoctions I can confidently say this blender fits the bill! The blender quickly broke up ice and large chunks of frozen fruit without any issues. It's slim enough to fit in my cabinets when not in use but also attractive enough to leave out! I love the sleek design and how the buttons only light up when in use. It would compliment any kitchen. I definitely recommend this blender to anyone who's in the market for a new blender."
I really love this blender! So easy to use and powerful BUT the clear part of the cover is stuck on there 🫤 it looks like it was inserted wrong? And now there’s no way of taking it off because it is off track.
I'm enjoying my new kitchen toy. Thank you Drew. I'm waiting for you to design the next espresso machine
"So far everything works great with my blender and all my beautiful appliances! I get so many compliments on my appliances, and I love them!"
"Four and counting! That's how many pieces of the Beautiful collection by Drew Barrymore I now have! None of them have disappointed so I am anxious for the newest addition, the Touchscreen Blender, to become a go to appliance in our kitchen!
Happily, this blender is lighter weight than the one it is replacing. But that doesn't take away from its power at all. It packs quite a punch! It has a standard 6 cup capacity.
Like the other Beautiful small appliances, the control panel is a hidden touchscreen that only illuminates when in use. This gives all the pieces in the collection a clean, sleek look.
There are 7 functions including a smoothie setting, which is the one we will use the most in this house. The blender almost instantly chopped thro..."
"Drew Barrymore Beautiful Blender This sleek blender is great addition to any kitchen. It beautiful design and gold handle add an elegant look to a usually ordinary appliance. The best feature is the touch screen. No more dirty buttons covered in whatever you were blending. The display stays dark until you turn it on. It is very powerful, it crushed the ice in my smoothie in no time , and I didn't have to shake it around to get to all the contents. I didn't like the warning written in white across the front of my black base, but I'm sure there a liability reason for making it a permanent warning label. Overall a great blender for the price and a nice addition to my “BEAUTIFUL” collection of small appliances."
"The Beautiful blender is great. It's so pretty. It looks great with my other Beautiful appliances. I made some margaritas with it and it crushed the ice to exactly the size I wanted. I like the digital display and that it disappears when your not using it. The sleek design looks nice on my counter. The only negative is what others mentioned about being unable to remove the caution statement but the words are so small you don't really notice them. All in all it is pretty and easy to use, and works well."
"like everything, the quality, color 😍 price."
"Upon unboxing my new blender, I was very dismayed to find an ugly warning disclaimer around the edge of the so-called sleek touchscreen. None of the product images on Walmart website or the Beautiful website include this printed warning on the touchscreen. I know what you’re thinking: “Duh, Amanda. Just peel it off!” Not so fast – the disclaimer is printed directly on the touchscreen and not on a removable film. I selected this blender for the clean look and the disclaimer makes this just as crummy looking as your average run-of-the-mill blender. The company’s customer service did get back to me in a timely manner to say it’s a sticker but I swear it’s not. I ended up attaching the touchscreen trying to peel it up. Why they manufactured the..."
This ‘Beautiful High Performance Touchscreen Blender' is lightweight yet strong enough for icy smoothies with fresh fruit. The elegant design fits beautifully on my juice bar. Health
"This toaster is beautiful. I love the touch to use pad. It is easy to use and does a great job. I have used it for bread and croissants so far. It looks great on the counter, in fact it is very nice to look at and adds to the beauty of the kitchen counter. I like the choices of items to toast. The reheat is a great feature in case you get busy and need a reheat. The crumb try is easy to remove and clean and put back takes less than 5 minutes. I highly recommend it."
"Easy to Use and Pretty! I love this pretty little toaster! It's soooo easy to use - unpack it, plug it in and go. I made toast. Placed my bread in the slots, hit the power button (all of the buttons will illuminate), press your desired option, lower the the lever, and the toaster does the rest. Fresh bread for toast uses the ""frozen"" button and I made my first batch with the factory setting for browning and it was perfect for me. So simple. There is, also, a little bottom shelf in the back of the toaster that catchs crumbs and easily slides out for cleaning. This toaster looks so cute and now has a permanent home on my breakfast nook counter. 5 stars."
"This toaster is the prettiest toaster I've ever owned!  It truly is a work of art.
I LOVE the color.  It isn't just pretty, however. It works great and has settings not just for toasting, but for warming things up and for bagels etc.
I like that it has the mechanism that hugs the slices of bread while toasting.
This toaster is super easy to use and looks spectacular on my counter in my kitchen.
This type of appliance is so special and pretty, that it would make a nice gift for anyone."
"A toaster is an important appliance in our household. We love toast, bagels, English muffins, waffles, pop-tarts, etc. So when we used this Beautiful Toaster by Drew Barrymore, we were all very impressed. First of all, it has such a high end look, and makes a kitchen look sophisticated. But more importantly, it functions really well. The toaster settings come in a wide range and even the other settings are helpful. We definitely appreciate the frozen setting for the items that come from the freezer.  And the LED feature is most impressive. Even the crumb tray is easy to remove and clean. This is such an attractive appliance that operates well and gets the job done. I highly recommend this Beautiful Toaster to anyone in the market for one fo..."
"The Beautiful 2 slice toaster is not only so aesthetically pleasing but also works tremendously! You can choose from the settings of bagel, frozen, or reheat and can adjust the level of browning with just the touch of the screen. It cooks both sides evenly and is super easy to use! Would highly recommend this to anyone!"
"The Beautiful toaster is a solid and attractive toaster. The color is a very pretty shade of green. The controls are easy to use, with a touch screen to select the level of toasting What I like most is that it accommodates a thin piece of bread to a half of a bagel and both toasted evenly."
"I ordered the Beautiful toaster based off of its elegant style and color at first. After receiving the toaster I realized that this is more then just a 2 slice toaster. Once plugged in I noticed the digital screen and all the options it actually has! Although my first time using the toaster it was just plain whole wheat sliced bread for my kids, it has tons of options for toasting, reheating, frozen, and much wider slots on the top for bagels! The digital display is very easy to see and use. One thing I did notice right away when the toast popped up is that it popped up high enough to grab easily especially for my kids, where my last toaster I had to always pry it up and out. The toast came out so perfectly brown and evenly covered! I would..."
"Super cute toaster! Love the color. It is so stylish, looks so nice on my counter. I really like the illuminated touch screen. Toasted an English muffin that was toasted perfect. Not too dark not to light, just right. All I had to do was push one button. If you are looking for a toaster that looks great on your counter and toasts to perfection this Beautiful toaster is for you"
"The Beautiful 2 Slice Toaster is very nice. I like the touch screen that lights up to give you the preset options for reheat, bagel or frozen. There is a sliding touch screen bar to select the darkness of your toast. Very easy to operate. The color is nice, mine was sage green and looks great in my kitchen. This toaster does the job just fine, I think most people would like this toaster for its sleek design and simple operation. I would recommend this toaster."
"I freeze my bread because just being me it takes forever to eat what I buy.  I did the frozen feature on my bagel and it came out evenly toasted, shocked I took a photo for you guys. I also toasted a hot dog bun in there last night for dinner. I love it has larger slots for food than my last one did. I also like it has a removable crumb tray which will make cleaning much easier."
"This beautiful toaster was very sleek in design. I loved the options: reheat, bagel, frozen or just the traditional toast at different levels. When I first saw the toaster, these options did not appear to be available. Once I plugged it in, the touch screen showed a power button which turned on to offer far more than just a traditional toaster. I love the clean look of the toaster and it really blends in to most any color and makes a wonderful addition to my kitchen. The manual that comes with the toaster is very clear with instructions and different attributes of the toaster. The packaging is beautiful as always with all of the beautiful products. The high points would definitely be the option to make lighter or darker toast, and the touch..."
Absolutely love this toaster. Works great and looks beautiful. I did paint the gold accents matte black to match my kitchen better but I love everything else about this purchase.
"Wow!!! I love the look of this toaster and when I used it, it was even better than I expected. Evenly toasted and very quick which is exactly what I needed it to be."
"My first toaster since 1972 and I Love It!! Modern technology is a wonderful thing and the Beautiful toaster checks all the boxes. Sleek design and easy to use. Have your toast, bagel, or frozen waffle hot and the desired shade you like."
I loved how  this looked. I bought the toaster and tea kettle as well. It's only been a couple months and the gold handle is starting to chip and break. Thai wasn't dropped so I don't understand.  It's ruined the whole aesthetic. I loved it until the crack and chip.
"I really like this line. Only thing I don't like is how the gold swatch is not the same. I got the coffee maker and the toaster toaster came a few days since it wasn't available other than online. Coffee maker is more rose gold, then the toaster came with more yellow gold. Others may not be bothered by it but, I am. Hope to find another toaster somewhere with the right gold that matches the ""B"" and coffee maker handle."
"This is a nice, sleek, easy to use toaster. It has a nice touch screen display. The best part is how fast it makes toast. I have been using a toaster oven that takes about 4 minutes to make toast. This took under 2 minutes to make toast. It does a better job at making toast than my toaster oven. I can’t wait to continue using this instead of the toaster oven."
"Everyone in my family is a big toaster user. We love to toast bagels and bread for sandwiches on a daily basis. So, it is very important for us to have a quality toaster. After using the Beautiful 2-Slice Toaster, we are VERY happy with the product! The toaster perfectly toasted everything we have put in. This morning I even toasted two large bagels we had previously frozen. Not only did the toaster toast the frozen bagels relatively fast, but they also came out PERFECT! I have never gotten such good quality from a toaster when toasting frozen bagels. Regular bread came out perfect, as well. I also love how nice the toaster looks on my countertop. The adjustable toast settings are straightforward and easy to operate. I love everything about..."
"It's really nice! I loved it, haven't used it yet but I love it……..BUT who ever was handling threw it or something because it has a very noticeable dint. Would return in but it took forever to get here…."
"I bought this toaster around a year ago and it no longer holds down the toast. I reached out to the company and they told me because I don't have a receipt they can't help me. I told them I could send a video of the toaster not working and still said they couldn't help me. I don't want money I just want a replacement toaster. Something only a year old should not stop working. Terrible customer service. I have a couple other beautiful appliances as well, the tea kettle also stopped working in less time. Needless to say won't be buying more products from them."
"Let me start off by saying I owned mainstays othe tpits and pans before I received this set and they are still being used 6 years later, I was so excited to try these new ones I immediately put them in my dishwasher and let them dry in there aswell. I cooked my usuals in them and nothing STICKS at all In these. They clean very easy and it's a plus they come with lids, I couldn't be more happier with this set if your looking for a affordable and durable pot set look no further!!"
"Just received the nonstick pot and pan set. 
I couldn't wait to cook.
Which I did . The food cooked evenly. I was able to take
The food outta the pots with out a hassle. Clean up was 
A breeze. And not tho mention the dark color of the pats matches very well 
With my kitchen ."
"This Mainstays cookware set ,makes an excellent gift for first home buyers or newlyweds, maybe even a college bound student. It's also a great set for the elderly that might have trouble lifting heavy pots and pans. This set is light weight and easy to clean. It's also dishwasher safe!..Everyone can use a nonstick set,easy clean up. It's an affordable set and cooks your food evenly. But be prepared to not have the heat too high, since it's not thick like most pots and pans , it will heat up your food quicker. Which is a plus for those of us in a hurry to get dinner on the table quickly."
"I just love this Mainstays 7-piece cookware set. The set was packaged really well and all the pots and pans were wrapped individually.
The weight of the cookware is great. The pots and pans really feel durable without being too heavy to lift. 
I really love the variety of sizes in this cookware set. The set includes a 1-quart saucepan with lid, a 2-quart saucepan with lid, a 4-quart Dutch oven with lid and an 8-inch skillet. It is a complete set. The set is great for a starter or to complete any kitchen.
Every piece is very durable. The design is modern and the pans are made of aluminum bodies with non-stick interiors.
The handles are very comfortable to hold and easy to grip. The non-stick inside makes it easy to clean the pans and foo..."
Mainstays cookeare set is surprisingly good. I say that because once i open the box and picked up one piece is was so so light. So are all other pieces so im thinking these are gonna burn quickly but was proven wrong. I instantly put a pan to cook a egg and less than 1 min it was done. It heats up quickly and nothing seems to stick. My best thing is are the handles they feel so comfortable with a solid feel in the hand. Covers are also great. Overall im really enjoying cooking with them. (Usually my wife does all the cooking.
"The color is more blue than green which I really love. Food does not stuck at all which makes clean up a breeze. The only negative is that somehow when I was cooking some noodles, the outside of the pain got a scorch mark. As far as I know, the contents never boiled over or anything and it's an electric stove so there was no flame. Being a light colored pan, the scorch mark is very noticeable unfortunately! I tried vinegar and baking soda on it and it seems a little lighter. But I was disappointed that it happened on my 1st use."
"These are very cheap and thin. They will not last long. While they are cute, the light weight material makes it it can be easily worn. The handles are very cheaply made as well. If you're looking for a low budget set to carry you for a few months, this will do."
the mint color is not mint at all it's more like light blue. The set is a great starter someone who is moving on their on for the first time.
"I purchased this set earlier this year with low expectations, and all the pots have been fine to use. I’ve used the frying pan 3 times and the whole exterior turned from blue to brown, I included a photo for reference…."
"Hads this pan since sep, 29, 2022 and barley opened them and this happened made my house smiling like gasoline and made it catch on fire thank god i was just there on time to put it out 😡🤬 i have children and im very disappointed with this. THEY NEED TO RECALL ON THESE COOKWARE!!!! Dont buy this item people...."
"I have used Mainstays 7 Piece Nonstick Cookware Set for a few
different things so far. Ive boiled spaghetti noodles made sauces
and soups. Lightweight set. Easy to clean thanks to the nonstick. 
They work great. The handles don't get warm or hot while your
cooking. That is a plus. Its a nice starter set or for people that 
can't lift heavy things due to injury or age etc. I could lift the pots and 
move them around with one hand 
I would definitely recommend this product."
"This Mainstays cookware set is perfect for those who are starting to explore the culinary world, or just trying to survive by cooking Top Ramen or Mac and Cheese. The set fulfills your basic cooking needs which includes 3 different size pots with lids and a pan. They're all non-stick which makes it a lot easier to cook and clean. I also love that everything is dishwasher safe (not all cookware are, so you better read the fine print) which makes it even easier on my life. I've only used all of the pots a few times so far and I haven't seen any excessive wear or tear. Overall, I think this is a great starter set or if you just need those extra pots and pan."
"Especially if you are just getting started setting up your own space - maybe in a dorm or new apartment - this is a good little set of Nonstick Dishwasher Safe Cookware. These pots and pans are not heavy to lift. They feel light-weight and do not have the heft of cookware that's made out of cast iron or other heavy materials. 

I mention this partly because my parents, as they've gotten older, have found the need to switch out their heavy cookware for lighter options. Things they used to lift with ease are now too much for them, leading to more spills and danger of burns. This cookware set would be easy for them to use (weight-wise) and also does not take up a large amount of space. That's something important to them as they downsize. As ..."
"This cookware set is fine for the price they are.
They are definitely not a heavy high end set. They are very light weight and fairly cheaply made. 
These would be great as a first set of cookware or for someone who does not cook much.
Pros:
Price is great
Cook food/boil water just fine
Dishwasher safe
Non-stick
Comes with a good variety pots/skillet/lids for your cooking needs

Cons:
Not very good quality (thin metal, plastic handles)
Skillet is very small
Too many lids--would be great if 1 lid fit all the pots"
"The Mainstays 7 Piece Nonstick Dishwasher Safe Cookware Set is a good light-weight, starter set of pots and pans. 

The fact that they are light-weight is not necessarily a bad thing. I would get these for my elderly mom who has trouble lifting heavy pans...or, a student setting up a new apartment.

Since they are so thin, they heat-up fast. You have to monitor your cook times and stir your ingredients often being careful when cooking things that could stick or burn easily (i.e. making gravy or sauces).

The 4 quart Dutch oven with lid is very good for cooking pasta. The thin pot heats the water faster, and the heavy glass lid--with a vent hole, keeps your lid from ""dancing"" while bringing to a boil. (The lids are my favorite part of ..."
In the set I found deformed pan
I just needed a cheap set of pots as I had very little money. First time using the pot and it ruined my stovetop
glass lids not safe! i brought one of these pans slowly up to cook temperature and the lid suddenly shattered!
I like the color of the pot set but you can tell it was inexpensive there was a c h i p on one of the pots like the paint was coming off of it.
"Right when I opened    so, upon further inspection, it look like the middle size pot was already used. I believe I got a box that was returned to Walmart for a refund and it was not checked thoroughly."
"As a proud new homeowner, I was looking for a blender that looked nice and matched my appliances. For our needs, this blender is a perfect fit! I haven't had it that long but from what I've seen it's made well and works great. My fiancé and I used it to make strawberry daiquiris. I was really impressed by the pulse feature. It blended the ice and frozen strawberries perfectly with the pulse button by moving the ingredients around without any additional help. Then we added some frozen mango with the same great results. The touch screen feature is great and makes for an easy clean. This blender is working great for us. Hope you're as happy with it as we are!"
"I didn't really think I was in the market for a blender, since I was using my mini blender/bullet. The problem with the bullet is that it is very limited in size and I noticed that things were getting stuck at the top of the cup (especially frozen fruit), not blending in with the rest of my smoothie. So, I decided to get a blender. I picked the Beautiful High Performance Touchscreen Blender at Walmart. First, it is so easy a first grader could use it. The buttons/functions light up. You choose the one you want, and the ingredients are blended in a flash. My morning smoothie is quick and easy, not to mention no annoying lumps are seeds in the mix. As for cleaning, that is also quick and easy. The blender is light and easy to lift as well as ..."
"This Beautiful blender will not disappoint! I have use it to make myself a slushee coffee and at first I used the smoothie option and it gave me perfect ice slivers. My next time I used purée and the ice was so fluffy and perfect! I love the digital display, no buttons to clean. The cup at the top fits perfect on the base. Make the buy! Treat yourself!"
"Beautiful… truly. Love the sleek, modern design. Works better than any other brand and the size of the jar is perfect for smoothies, mixing cocktails or simply chopping and blending other veggies. It's digital so it gives my kitchen the most modern look and feel plus this blue color looks very classy and matches perfectly with my stainless steel appliances. I give this a 10  all around"
This is my new favorite kitchen gadget! I love the sleek design and look. With it being all digital I like that the “buttons” are hidden until you need to use it. It definitely goes well with my very modern look I have going on in my kitchen. It works great as well! All the functions work just as you need them to and clean up is a breeze! Best new kitchen gadget so far!
"This is my first Touch Activated Blender and I like it! I decided to try a coffee smoothie and it turned out perfect. Directions were simple for the appliance and I really liked “no buttons” on a blender, just a touch screen. Clean up was easy too. Not too big of an appliance to fit on my counter top either."
"So far this has been a great little blender for my morning smoothies. I love the white and gold!

However, I, like other reviewers, was disappointed in the warning label in black letters on the front of the machine which was not visible in the shopping link images. However, I dabbed a little acetone on a cotton round and successfully removed the letters with no damage to my machine. 

I would have given 5 stars had the images not been deceiving."
"I didn't expect that this blender would be able to keep up with the old vitamix one I had. This is powerful. I have made smoothies, chopped ice, cleaning function. I love it. It is pretty with the gold trim on handle and it's slim. But the touch buttons I dont like, if my hands are wet or if I'm multitasking, the buttons don't respond. You have to press hard and sometimes multiple times before the machine turns on. The cord is short. I mean ridiculously short. At this point companies know you have multiple items on your counter. Why the short cord. Its only about 12 inches. And some of that is used to come around the blender. I had to shuffle things around and put this in the very front of my outlet. Away from the sink, so now I have water ..."
"I am so sad to write this, because I wanted to love this so much since I love Drew… but I haven’t even had this a year yet (and I have maybe used it less that 50 times…) and something inside broke and shot out a metal nut from inside the machine!! It also made an awful sound… and honestly it’s never really worked well… I am so sad and disappointed, and Walmart won’t let me return it. Ugh.."
"Don't waste your money!!  This is not a deal! Absolutely garbage. So finicky, have to use your strength to hold it down on the base or jumps off. Worked about two weeks and now it's just making a terrible metal on metal grinding noise but won't turn. I included a photo that shows metal shavings in the bottom. Even though the base fits together fine, it keeps grinding and won't spin the blades."
"A blender is one of those small kitchen appliances that is absolutely essential to a kitchen. I make fruit smoothies every day for breakfast and need a good blender. It's important to me that a blender is slim in size yet powerful in blending. After making frozen margaritas, frozen fruit smoothies, and a few other concoctions I can confidently say this blender fits the bill! The blender quickly broke up ice and large chunks of frozen fruit without any issues. It's slim enough to fit in my cabinets when not in use but also attractive enough to leave out! I love the sleek design and how the buttons only light up when in use. It would compliment any kitchen. I definitely recommend this blender to anyone who's in the market for a new blender."
I really love this blender! So easy to use and powerful BUT the clear part of the cover is stuck on there 🫤 it looks like it was inserted wrong? And now there’s no way of taking it off because it is off track.
I'm enjoying my new kitchen toy. Thank you Drew. I'm waiting for you to design the next espresso machine
"So far everything works great with my blender and all my beautiful appliances! I get so many compliments on my appliances, and I love them!"
"Four and counting! That's how many pieces of the Beautiful collection by Drew Barrymore I now have! None of them have disappointed so I am anxious for the newest addition, the Touchscreen Blender, to become a go to appliance in our kitchen!
Happily, this blender is lighter weight than the one it is replacing. But that doesn't take away from its power at all. It packs quite a punch! It has a standard 6 cup capacity.
Like the other Beautiful small appliances, the control panel is a hidden touchscreen that only illuminates when in use. This gives all the pieces in the collection a clean, sleek look.
There are 7 functions including a smoothie setting, which is the one we will use the most in this house. The blender almost instantly chopped thro..."
"Drew Barrymore Beautiful Blender This sleek blender is great addition to any kitchen. It beautiful design and gold handle add an elegant look to a usually ordinary appliance. The best feature is the touch screen. No more dirty buttons covered in whatever you were blending. The display stays dark until you turn it on. It is very powerful, it crushed the ice in my smoothie in no time , and I didn't have to shake it around to get to all the contents. I didn't like the warning written in white across the front of my black base, but I'm sure there a liability reason for making it a permanent warning label. Overall a great blender for the price and a nice addition to my “BEAUTIFUL” collection of small appliances."
"The Beautiful blender is great. It's so pretty. It looks great with my other Beautiful appliances. I made some margaritas with it and it crushed the ice to exactly the size I wanted. I like the digital display and that it disappears when your not using it. The sleek design looks nice on my counter. The only negative is what others mentioned about being unable to remove the caution statement but the words are so small you don't really notice them. All in all it is pretty and easy to use, and works well."
"like everything, the quality, color 😍 price."
"Upon unboxing my new blender, I was very dismayed to find an ugly warning disclaimer around the edge of the so-called sleek touchscreen. None of the product images on Walmart website or the Beautiful website include this printed warning on the touchscreen. I know what you’re thinking: “Duh, Amanda. Just peel it off!” Not so fast – the disclaimer is printed directly on the touchscreen and not on a removable film. I selected this blender for the clean look and the disclaimer makes this just as crummy looking as your average run-of-the-mill blender. The company’s customer service did get back to me in a timely manner to say it’s a sticker but I swear it’s not. I ended up attaching the touchscreen trying to peel it up. Why they manufactured the..."
This ‘Beautiful High Performance Touchscreen Blender' is lightweight yet strong enough for icy smoothies with fresh fruit. The elegant design fits beautifully on my juice bar. Health
It is one of the best purchases I have made. It is a very useful appliance in the daily life of a woman who works and also cooks for her family.
best purchase ever!! i do everything in the air fryer. Amazing definitely recommended
I love my Nonja Air Fryer!  I cook more with this than on the stove!  Even reheating is better than microwave.
One of the best purchase. Easy to use and clean. Good quality
Wonderful Product! Walmart gave superb delivery.
great size and price!
"I'm in LOVE with this air fryer and don't know how I survived without it! IT's just for the 2 of us at home but is plenty big for a couple of slices of pizza, or 20 chicken nuggets. I've also made apple dumplings, potstickers, fried potatoes, and of course reheating soggy fries I've brought home from restaurants is a dream."
"I’ve wanted a Ninja Air Fryer for a while and had been keeping an eye on the different models and prices. I was ordering something else online at Walmart and decided to check to see what Walmart had. I was surprised to find this air fryer at a deep holiday discount unmatched anywhere else and snapped it up. It does a terrific job and is the perfect size for me, so it’s not taking up a lot of counter space in my smaller kitchen. Walmart had the best price I’ve seen for this item and it was delivered just hours after I ordered it. Amazing service!"
This is my 1st air fryer and after reviewing many I chose Ninja. I LOVE my Ninja Air Fryer! I purchased 3 weeks ago and so far everything is fantastic. The flounder and salmon tasted just like it was off the grill. I purchased the parchment paper inserts …so helpful when using your air fryer and for clean up too. Btw Walmart had the best price so TY Walmart!
"The concept of dry-air cooking is not new. Yet, this sleek, designer-looking Ninja AF100WM brings the thought to an efficiency-styled apartment. There was no - or a minuscule amount - of setup. It was out of the box onto the kitchen counter. Most time was in learning what it can do!"
"So far I think the Ninja air fryer is everything I was looking for.  I only used it once since I bought it, but I air fried a chicken breast and it was so delicious, it reminded of a taste from long ago. I'm excited to try other recipes as I get to know how to use it.  I would recommend it to others looking for an air fryer."
"Everybody said to get a Ninja air fryer, and they were right. Four quarts is too big for the two of us, but that's okay. Great Black Friday price from Walmart."
Haven't tried it yet as it is a Christmas gift. But I gave a 5 star because Ninja has always been a good brand. I will say delivery was very fast and came in in good condition.
"Thoroughly enjoy the ease of use and variability of application.  Wish a two-tier insert was included.  Will make my own from a wire mesh and proper gauge wire.
Excellent appliance!"
Great price at $69.00. I been using it for everything instead of the oven or microwave. Love the crispy brown crust and the tender moist inside of everything I cook. Highly recommended
The Ninja air fryer has become the workhorse appliance in our kitchen. It is irreplaceable for my two small children. This thing has pumped out thousands of Dino nuggets and meatballs In the last year. Cooks quickly and cleans up easy.
"Love this air fryer, this purchase is for family,  we made our purchase last year and can't say enough great things about this model,  we eat much healthier now, versus deep frying."
"I really likes the Ninja Air Fryer. It's awesome how it works. I prepared some steaks,  fries, yuca fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, etc. I recommend this product. Enjoy!!@home!!"
Always wanted a Ninja and now I have one.  I love this air fryer.   Easy to use and easy to clean.   Came with easy to understand set up and instructions on how to use. It also came with a recipe booklet.
"I LOVE this air fryer! I did a lot of research to find an air fryer that is the right size and won’t smell like burning plastic or smoke up. Unfortunately this one does have a burning plastic smell the first two days. The next day it went away! I made chicken stir fry, brownies, roasted potatoes and zucchini, and tonight I made pita bread pizza. All of them turned out amazing except the brownies, mostly because I don’t have baking experience. Overall, it’s a great product for a single serving meal."
"I like the product ,because it's a 7-in-1 .You can  do a lot of different recipes  with it."
"Easy to use 
Cook's great"
"I made Chicken soup last night just by sautéing carrots, celery and onions (IN THE INSANT POT!) then adding a WHOLE chicken. It cooked in 20 minutes! So easy and only 1 pot to clean. I love this thing!"
I love this item. Easy to use. Great for quick low maintenance meals❤️
"It's a lot more work to clean the pot lid than I realized. More than my old Presto pressure cooker, and a lot more than my scratched Aroma rice cooker that I bought the Instant Pot to replace, or than the crock pots I also thought this would replace. There are tiny parts easily lost and a gasket that's tricky to remove and reseat. I wouldn't buy it if I had it to do over, but now that I own it I'll use it. Sometimes. Like, for pulled pork and pot roasts.
Plus, it's bulky and the lid blocks my cupboard doors when I rest it on its side as designed. I may end up buying another $20 rice cooker as well."
box came ripped and it was supposed to be a gift
"I was so excited to get this pot. I have always been afraid of contemporary pressure cookers due to the explosions I've seen. Every time i use this pot, it burns my food. I use the rack that came with it and it still scorches and burns my food. I've tried several different things to avoid the food burning. This pot scorches soup to the bottom and once it scorches, it ruins the whole pot. Waste of time and money. Highly disappointed."
"this item is shipped by a third-party party. they offered me upgradation to 8qt instead of 6qt since the item stack is over. i agreed, and it got shipped. but the product came in a normal cardboard box and looks like that item is refurbished or used by others. also, i want a stainless steel item inside ,but the specifications are not the same as what i ordered for 6qt. i wanted to retun it, but they are not agreeing to take it back and refund my amount.  i am highly disappointed with walmart for  wasting my money, time, and effort."
"This is my 2nd Instant Pot and I love the IP.  I have had this IP for almost 2 weeks but I haven't used it.  I have tried everything under the sun to get the sticky label residue off the lid.  Nothing has worked.  I know that if I get the IP lid hot, it will cook on and I will never get it off!!  I think they should send me a lid that isn't made unusable by the label."
Arrived with the handle broken from the 'pot' & cracked.  The box was undamaged & the handle wasn;t in the box.  It would appear I was sent a broken return that they just put in a new box.  (I'm surprised they asked for a rating)
I got a damaged product
Could not live without it.  Youtube has many helpful hints and recipes.   I have a glass lid that use on it after take pressure top off.  Also got a plastic lid to go on inner pot to store in refrigerator.  Great cooking device.  15 bean soup is excellent with this pressure pot and youtube cooking advice.  Quick easy painless.
I’m late to the game but this thing is a game changer for dinner prep and cooking. I’ve used it a handful of times now and the meat is so tender. Also cooks fast. There’s so many settings that I still need to learn but so far have only used the poultry setting
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have heard a lot of people rave about the ease and use of an Instant Pot and I was not disappointed by my experience. The Instant Pot Duo 6qt is a nice size for cooking a meal. I was a little hesitant as I did not know how to use, but this was actually very simple. There are plenty of different settings and after browsing through recipes online, it was easy to find detailed instructions for whatever dish I wanted to create. My first attempt was chunky applesauce and it tasted amazing. Of course, homemade is always better with most food, and this was easier than my typical stovetop method. I'm happy to have a new device to cook healthy meals and eliminate as much junk food or takeout as p..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We love our Instapot! It has become a must have kitchen appliance for us!   I found the design of this one to be nice as it has more of a compact design without loosing any cooking space.  I also found it to be incredibly easy to clean.  One of my favorite things to cook in it is rice, which there is a rice option button on it. All you have to do is push the button and you are good to go.  I highly recommend this specific Instapot to anyone who is in the market for an upgrade or looking to purchase their first one!"
"The store sold me a used one! Smelled like curry %26 had a bag of unused sponges. Clearly someone returned it %26 Walmart had the nerve to deliver it to me. WHY? 
Now I don't trust their delivery service. Walmart has NO quality control. Guess it's time I shop exclusively at Target."
"Little difficult to figure out and you'll need to purchase additional accessories to make a lot of the recipes, but ultimately an amazing time saver for busy weeknights! Such a variety of dishes you can make for all occasions with less than half the effort! You DEFINITELY need to read the directions and have a good understanding of its functions if you want to put out the yummy dishes included in the recipe book."
"Love my IP for all sorts of recipes from beans to rice to ribs. Cooks a variety of dishes rapidly and often from frozen. There is a learning curve, but so many YouTube videos and great Instant Pot recipes online it is easy to learn! Great customer support, too. 

A good size for a couple or small family. Many useful function buttons. Highly recommend for an RV and/or home kitchen."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Instant Pot Duo 6 quart is perfect delicious food cooked in a short amount of time!  This is my first experience with a pressure cooker and all fears have been erased by the thorough directions and reminder labels located on the pot.  It has 12 cooking options!  Today I made the best split pea soup ever using the 1000 recipe cookbook provided on the web by Instant Pot.  I sautéed first in the Instant Pot.  It then took 15 minutes to reach the pressure setting and cooked in just an additional 15 minutes!!!  I used natural steam release which is best for stews, chili, pasta, oatmeal, beans and grains (foods that expand). There is also a quick steam release for other foods.  Cleanup is easy. ..."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This review is for the Instant Pot Duo 6-quart Multi-Use Pressure Cooker. I chose this Instant Pot because it is not just a pressure cooker but has a 7 in 1 functionality which includes slow cook, rice cooker, steamer and you can even make yogurt with it! I have a good sized kitchen and still not enough counter space which makes a multifunctionality cooker very attractive. The Instant Pot Duo has 13 customizable smart programs and a very sleek design.
I was a little bit intimidated after reading the warning instructions because I have never used a pressure cooker before but always wanted one. It did make me feel more comfortable to read that the Instant Pot has 10 safety features to avoid..."
"These Wonder Nation Pillow Slides are prefect for my 5 year old. 
For quick trips out, light outside play, or just to wear around the house, these slides are great. They are a comfortable feeling, squishy design that his feet slide into easily. He can run across the yard and the slides do not fall off. The strap over the top of his foot is secure but not too tight and holds the shoe in place very well. The tread on the bottom is good. He has gotten them a little wet, but still didn't slide around. The sizing was accurate for us. I feel like they are true to size. They are also easy to clean. I can spray them off with the hose if they get muddy, and I can also easily wipe them down with a wet cloth. My kiddo has gotten these slides pretty d..."
"I have been seeing these type of pillow slides everywhere and so have my children so of course both of my boys wanted to try these out. They came in and I was so surprised at how nice the quality of these slides are. They are super comfortable, like walking on pillows for real. I do believe that they run a little big in my opinion but my youngest in in between sizes so maybe not. 
Either way, they are made very well and the kids like the designed on them."
My son loves these slides. He said it feels like he's walking on clouds! He also said pillows. He has been wearing them nonstop at home. He also loves the design on them. He said he's the coolest kid on the block. Anything that makes my kids feel confident is something I'm going to invest in. I recommend these.
"My son loved these. The design is super fun and the sandal is very confortable and soft.
It gies with everything, and looked awesome with his halloween costume!"
"The sandal is comfortable and built tough (at least they feel like)!
I like the sole material that is a little softer/stickier than typical slide sandals. 
The size is a tidbit bigger than I expected, but still my boy can walk around without difficulty. 
I haven't had a chance to test the grip on a wet surface though."
"We got these thinking of them being perfect for after our son's MMA class, little did I know they would take over his wardrobe! 

They are very cute, very squishy, and very addictive if you are seven. 

My son loves them and I love that they stay on his feet well. Highly recommend!"
"My kid loves these things to the point of not wanting to wear anything else! Honestly, I can see why. When I received them and took them from the package, I felt how much cushion they would have for my kids feet and I was honestly surprised! I normally wear Nike Air slides and to me, they don't feel as comfortable as these did with the squeeze test! The emoji on it is a nice added touch, it has a thunderstorm cloud with a lightning bolt for one of the eyes! I felt that it was pretty creative!"
The first thing that caught my eye with these children's slides was the cute smiley graphic. It's different than the typical slide which is great! The next thing I noticed was how cushiony (is that a word- LOL!) they were. My son hasn't taken them off since getting them so they are kid approved too!
These slides are so on trend I can't handle it. My son even thinks they are cute. I do feel like they run a little on the larger size - but he will grow into them come summer.
"These shoes are super cute but run big. My son wears a 12 in Nikes and these were a little too big, but no problem he will be in them soon. He said they were like walking on cotton. I'm guessing that meant soft. Lol. The smiley face is perfect for a young boy."
My kids love these sandals. The emoji design is super cute on the side. They say they are super comfortable and love wearing them everywhere. I plan to buy more!
"My grandson loved his new sandals. They have become his quick go to sandals. They are constructed well an made with quality durable material. The smiley emoji design is cute and popular. Great choice to go with,"
"They are well made, thick material . Looks like they will last long for my six year old. He loved the design on them and he immediately said, “ they are very comfy” . I will have to find another pair for my older son."
These slides run huge. My 8 year old is a size 2 so I decided to buy the 2/3 and these are like a women's size 6.
I received an adult man size instead of child's size. Thank goodness my spouse was able to fit it.
"Honestly, I thought it wouldn't be great because of the price but they are pretty nice"
These are more comfortable than i thought they'd be and better looking too. I've gotten lots of compliments on these shoes!
Bought these for my husband and he is very impressed with them. He likes this look. Love the feeling. Comfortable and practical. very nice. support. He stands all day. Best sneakers he's ever worn.
"comfy shoes, made in china, fast delivery, nice packaging, good for walking, i have to use insoles though!"
"Nice light weight comfortable shoe, could use a more padded insole. Wish they came in 9, only offer 8 1/2 or 9 1/2."
"I wanted light shoes. These are extremely light. They remind me of my track shoes ,without the spikes ,from high school.  Very nice as long as they will last."
"looks nice, put together well."
"I ordered US size 12. My son tried them on and they are too small, more like size 11. I cannot confirm they are the correct size, as there is no label on the shoes themselves and the bag has a sticker in Chinese with the number 46 on them.  The shoes look to be good quality otherwise."
I was sent a USED pair of shoes.  picture attached.  Disgusting!
These are the worst shoes ever they are poorly built the materials are horrible they feel like they should have been purchased at the dollar store do not buy
my son likes them he says they are comfortable
great shoes for such a cheap price.
my son loves them say they are comfortable
they do run large for length but the width of the shoe is just right for large feet
"shoe quality not not what was expected. does not seem to be leather as stated.
Not soft and/or flexible."
extremely light weight and very comfortable
cheap sneakers uncomfortable
I like the comfort and looks of shoes!  Also reveived compliments on style and looking comfortable!
I am buying from Argentina and I liked the fulfillment of the delivery and the follow-up of the same by mail
I dont appreciate being charged double for the same purchase

"These are practical work shoes for standing/walking. I usually wear a wide, 9 1/2 shoe in Women's. This 8W in Men's is the perfect conversion for me. 

As a homemaker, I'm often on my feet for long periods of time. So, I prefer wearing these shoes around the house for both comfort and support. The layer of memory foam in the soles makes a big difference. 

For convenience, these shoes are also slip-ons. There's a loop of strong ribbon on the back of each heel to help pull the shoe firmly up on my foot. Instead of having a traditional lace, the front closure is a fixed elastic cord sewn at points along the front tongue and sides. Though the elastic doesn't adjust, it's the perfect length for me, where my circulation isn't affected and I ..."
"If you are looking for a great comfortable athletic shoe at a reasonable price, the Athletic Works Men's Rudy Athletic Jogger Sneakers is what you are looking for. They look great, slip-on, with bungee laces, and a mesh upper. Memory foam insoles. This shoe comes in all sizes, for men women, and children. As much as we should change our shoes this is a perfect shoe to own, Even the experts say to change your shoes about every 6 months. I recommend this product."
"My grandson thanked me for these sneakers because he stands on his feet most of the day. He told me once his feet touched the inside it was so comfortable and he hugged me for looking out for him.
He said they are cool because they are airy yet soft on the feet."
"I really like these Athletic Works Men's Rudy Athletic Jogger shoes in Black. They look sporty and stylish and are very comfortable. . The fabric is very smooth with a breathable knit. They will be good for around the house, walking, going for a drive. Basically for light wear. They slip on and off very easily and are handy to have. If needed, I believe that they will clean up with just a damp cloth."
"I purchased these for my teen son for state park walks, because I didn't want him ruining his expensive sneakers. They're nice basics at a super low cost, and they run true to size. The memory foam sole is quite comfortable. The tread is more firm than flexible, but offers good traction. The material reminds me of a thick nylon like microfiber. It isn't super breathable, but does keep the feet from getting wet. The bungee, no tie, laces have stretch to them, and make for easy on and off. For the price, these are great shoes for walks and mowing the yard, however, I wouldn't buy them for everyday wear and expect them to last more than a few months."
"These are comfortable slip on shoes that you don't have to worry about tying laces. The only complaint I may have is that the sole is kind of like a croc shoe sole. Possable to slip in these with the right conditions. Other than that, they are easy to slip on and look nice."
I got these sneakers for my husband. No..he is not a jogger. But these are nice light weight sneakers. Easy to put on because of the no-tie laces. Just slip them on. He uses them when we go to eat or out shopping. It seems like so many mens shoes are so heavy...not these.
"These are nice-looking shoes. That's actually what I'm the most impressed with. I'm also the type of person that doesn't like tying my shoes every time I put them on, so these are perfect for that. They have laces but you don't tie them. They are pretty comfortable but not good enough to stand in all day. Overall I'm happy with these shoes."
"Heal wears out quickly.  Though comfortable sneaker.

These sneakers are very comfortable. They feel more like a slipper than a sneaker. They easily slip on and off with the elasticized laces. They are perfect for wearing around the house and yard.
"I have a factory job and I bought these in an attempt to save money on shoes for work. They are tight in the toe area. The bottom feels like it is just styrofoam blocks glued on. Not comfortable, especially for an 8  hour shift of standing/walking all day. I would not recommend these to anyone."
i want to return them
"These shoes are very comfortable. You can simply step into them without really needing to use your hands. They are light weight. They may not last for a year, with constant use, but for this price you can buy three pair for the price of one of the other brands. That is what I do.  I bought two pair. One I used for work. When they started to look dirty after 6 months, I started using the other pair for work and the first pair became my 'daily use' shoes for shopping, yard work, walks etc."
"I ordered these for an older gentleman who really likes this style. He says they're comfortable and give him great traction. This is his second pair. After washing the first pair, he put them in the dryer and the toe area shrunk enough to make them uncomfortable, so if you wash them, you should probably dry them in the sun."
My son has wide feet so I had to purchase him shoes to accommodate the width. These are perfect. So he doesn't have to worry about raw skin on his feet from tight shoes. Definitely worth the price!

comfortable to walk plus don't have to
lace them up. they are best pair of sneakers

This pair of tennis shoes are doing good so far. I really hope this brand made this shoes with better quality. if they last more than three months I will let you all know.
"Cheap, but nice shoes. The only issue I have with them (multiple pairs) is the bottom lining inside comes out after about two weeks. Then after 3-4 weeks the cushion becomes loose and makes it a pain to get the shoes on and off. If they would fix this they would be 5 star!"
Soooo Soooo comfortable and a nice zip lock bag to keep them in. I reordered all colors. They are not made for everyday hard work but perfect  for a nice breakfast or lunch or an evening out with new looking shoes and out right back in their bag after wiping off soles.👍🏼
"I loved these sneakers, but had to return them. I have a few issues with my feet and these didn't help. If you have average (good) feet, I'm sure you will love these sneakers.
Walmart's shopping and returns are fantastic. It's my favorite place to find everything, including great service."
they are cute i wear a size 8 and i definitely should of gotten a 7
"for l
just a plain walking shoe, no bells and whistles. These completely rock!"
"Really like these shoes. What appears to be the tongue is attached to the shoe. My only problem was keeping my toes in the shoe until I could fit my heel into them. Otherwise, they are lightweight, and for me at 62, stylish. I like them."
Decent looking and seems to fit good. The shoe laces only lasted about two weeks.
I purchased the sneakers for myself but I had to return them because they were too small even though they are men's
Cheap material but good shoes .
Advertised as a running/walking shoe.  Absolutely not!  Very poor quality and soles have zero support.  Can't even wear them as a house shoe.
"very poir quality, returned."
JUNK.  CHEAP Junk.  Can not get my foot in the shoe.  Returned quickly.  Save your time.  Buy something else.
unable to put on if wearing socks
look fine but not enough foot support. they are cheap so that is what expected.
The shoes are great will buy again
"Nice,sneaker real nice and very light weight. Very happy 😊"
Great for comfort and easily cleaned.
order size 11 but much too small
I'm very satisfied with my order
soft walking shoes for exercise or jogging very comfortable must buy

"I am a big fan of Avia shoes, and as usual these do not disappoint. I have worn a similar pair of Avia athletic shoes for about three years and they have been great. I suspect these will last just as long without issue. Avia is the only brand of athletic shoes that I will buy anymore. They fit my feet like they have been custom made for me. They are so comfortable compared to other brands I have owned. This model of shoe has memory foam insoles which really cushions while walking. In the past I have purchased expensive, popular brands of athletic shoes and I have not been impressed. Since discovering Avia I have stayed with the brand. I like that they offer a wide width, which is what was sent to me to review. I do wish they had more offeri..."
"My future son in law likes how comfortable the shoe fits his foot. Not too narrow, he has already used it on his hiking trail with my daughter and he said it took a beating in the woods but it is easy to clean and it did not falter even when the trail was a bit wet and muddy."
"These Avia shoes fit great and they look awesome. It has memory foam in the bottom so they are super comfortable. They seem to be made very well so should hold up for a long time and the bottoms are non marking and don’t seem to slip much as it was raining a little the first time I wore them. Over all a great pair of shoes, I definitely recommend these."
"I was wanting a pair of these shoes because of the testimonials about how they help you walk better and help your back. I have been wearing them for a few days and they feel great and so does my back. I've been having lower back pain,. I was told it was because of the way I walk and I need to try a pair of Avias. My mom has missionary in her legs and I had bought her a pair and she loves them. I wasnt thinking of myself, of course at that time. Finally I got a pair and I really enjoy them. I have no complaints, and they look really nice too. I highly recommend for the style and definitely for the comfort. (And for me, pain relief) 2 thumbs up all the way."
"I wore the shoes for the first time today and they were really comfortable. Often times I feel that I need to break shoes in, but I didn’t feel that way with these. I have wide feet and these were 10w, maybe that and the memory foam sole are the reason. The look and design are great, and they seem good quality. Looking forward to wearing them again."
"It is lightweight and perfect for running and trail. It has breathing material on the top which makes it more comfortable during running or jogging. It has a memory foam that feels comfortable during running. I do not feel more comfortable during the street running. However, it is perfect for the trial. It is wide enough to feel more comfortable during the running. one thing that I feel that it should make it a little waterproof on the top material. Therefore, if some of the spots are wet during the trails then the socks do not wet during the trail."
"AVIA JAG SHOE

These seem to be a solid shoe, of course, time will tell how well they will hold up, but so far, so good. They aren’t heavy nor are they really light (meaning cheap feeling). A nice thick sole and memory foam cushion on the inside to keep your feet comfortable. For $25, the quality seems to be better than other shoes I have purchased in this price range so I say they are a good deal. If they last a year or more, they will be a great deal. 

I got the brown ones and the color is a little darker on mine than the picture, but nothing to worry about. These are fine shoes to do stuff around the yard, go for walks/hikes or even a short jog/run. I don’t think I would use these for a 10+ mile run, you would probably want running ..."
"Avia Jag trail shoes for men look like very well made trail sneakers even though they are economically-priced shoes. They are designed for dirt trails so they feel a bit stronger than the conventional sneakers. Avia Jag are not light like some running sneakers which is not surprising, but they are still very light for their purpose. 
Inside the shoes, there is memory foam for feet to feel fresh according to the label. So on the comfort level, I would rate them upper middle comfort which is not the most comfortable but definitely not uncomfortable to wear for longer periods.
One of the positives is that these trail shoes are available in wide width which many other manufacturers do not make. Design-vise, they are very much athletic and spo..."
"The shoe is nice looking. Design is eye catching and material is durable. I like the color scheme. The overall look is very attractive. When I put on shoes, the first noticeable thing was the shoe's grip. It's firm and sticks to the ground pretty good. An excellent choice for jog, tracking and even for immature climbing. The memory foam layer adds comfort. The only reason I won't give 5 star rating is that the soul is made of some hard material (plastic?). That makes the shoes noisy and hard."
I really like these trail sneakers. I did have to add insoles to make them a little more comfortable but my feet are always hurting so someone else may not have to add them. They have a very thick bottom and great traction for just about any activity. The upper section seems to be made of very strong material and stitched together very well. I give it 4 stars because I needed to add insoles.
"I normally wear Moab 2s when hiking and while these shoes are only half the price they are pretty decent substitutes. I find them easier to clean after a hike and I prefer these flat laces to the Moab's round. The Avias feel lighter yet still have plenty of grip. I'm always digging the toe into sharp things so I like the toe cap design.

I normally wear a size 10.5 medium shoe and these sneakers in size 10.5 fit me just right."
"I have been using these shoes from a couple of weeks now. They are really comfortable, sturdy, lightweight and good looking. I have been on a couple of trails wearing these and they are rock solid and work like a charm. 

I usually wear size 11 and i ordered the same online. Even though it is really comfortable, I would say they are tiny bit bigger. But I got used to it within few days. I would totally recommend these shoes."
"I wasn't really sure what to expect with these ""trail sneakers."" I haven't had Avia shoes before, usually opting for what I consider premium running/jogging shoes from Asics. That said, my expectations of these were easily exceeded!

Oddly, the shoes didn't come in a shoe box. No biggie, I didn't need something new to throw away. They come pre-laced with some paper stuffed in them to keep their shape - once you take that out, you're ready to go! My first feel of them was very nice - the memory foam sole isn't squishy, which is nice, but does provide padding. The heel feels like it has a slight curve (on the bottom) that wraps around my foot, which also feels great.

After wearing for a couple days both on some light outdoor trails and a..."
"Arrived nicely packaged, I was quite surprised when I put them on. They felt very I mean very comfortable, soft inside and heavy-duty on the outside, I took these for a 3 mile walk and they did not hurt my feet at all. The material feels well made to last and the different color selections you have is the icing on the cake. For the price you can't go wrong. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"I especially liked the look of these sneakers. The darker colors usually look clean longer when I inevitably get them dirty. The extra padding on the sides gives me hope that I won’t tear them up working on the lawn or in the garage. At first, putting them on, I noticed they seemed a little stiff. The sole is taller than other sneakers, so I felt a little taller. I have gotten a little more used to them after wearing them several times. The sizing seems as expected. I also like the style of laces. They stay tied, unlike some lace styles. They are not the most comfortable sneakers I’ve worn, but I will continue to wear them when walking or going to stores, and other leisure activities. For the price, I am pleased."
"I never heard of the company named Avia who designs and manufactures them, but these shoes are something that I was really was excited about arriving.  I got the size 9 wide and they fit just as they should.  I ended up going with the wide version this go around because my feet were getting a little too big for standard size 9. I know I made the right choice!! I have worn them for a total of about 2 weeks now and they are very comfortable. I have not had the first bad experience wearing these.  Inside there is a memory foam insert that goes into the shoe that makes it an absolute pleasure to walk in.  They come with a black, grey, and light green color scheme that is throughout the shoe as well as the laces.  The bottom of the shoes tread i..."
"I love these shoes. They fit excellent and true to size. I work in a warehouse and they are comfortable all day long. They breath easy so my feet are dry. Great for out doors too, too cold and pandemic has that plan on pause. These look great with any attire and compliment pants and jeans. Will definitely recommend for someone looking for casual to outdoor shoes."
"I have been wearing this Athletic Shoe since I got them.  This one replace the Avia Athletic Shoe I got from Walmart, and this time I pay less."
These shoes are great. True to size and actually wide. I got size 9 and they fit perfectly. I used these outside in a foot of snow to test the traction and didn't slip once. Good solid shoes with great laces.
"Can't believe how comfortable these are. Surprised me at that price.
I normally wear these Trail Sneakers now for about 5 or 6 years now.
I wore running shoes before. Lots of cushioning in these .Both the sole and sides."
"My son loves these sneakers. They have become very hard to find though, and buying online has become challenging. The black picture states they are gray, and the gray picture states they are black. When ordering what I thought was a black pair, I received gray."
"The Athletic Works Toddler Boys Mesh Jogger is a dream for parents. They hit a very comfortable price point, and are pretty darn good quality sneaker! Personally, as my son's feet grow and morph... he's not in a stable size for more than six months. So purchasing these joggers are perfect for play, running, jumping and any other activity Toddlers get into! I've bought several colors for my daughter, and the same for my son. They are comfortable to wear, easy to put in and take off, easy to spot clean or wash... I mean, this brand and style is a dream. Your child's feet will not be constricted, pinched or too sweaty. The padding/cushion is great. The toe coverage is enough for scrapes and bumps, and the velcro definitely holds up! Love these..."
I got these for my one year old. He usually takes his shoes of again the second I get them on. These are different though. He always keeps them on and he will run and walk in them without problems. I think he prefers them cause they weight next to nothing as opposed to other brands. They look adorable on him and go with literally any outfit! They basically look like little Nikes but at a fraction of the price. I swear I even caught his smiling as his dad was putting them on him the other day!
"The top of the shoe is breathable fabric for good ventilation in hot weather. The bottoms are nonslip for safer running...and they have white soles, so they won't scuff the gym floor. My 3 year old loves them...we got a size 9 amd he wears almost a 4T in clothing. I love the velcro so there are no laces to trip over. These are the best toddler sneakers I've had, and I have 3 kids. 100% recommend! Very cute too. Very sporty."
"My grandson toddler is extremely active- all he wants to do is run around and be outside in our backyard jumping in mud puddles, playing in gravel, running in grass or walking with us down the . I needed a durable backup shoe for him . I got these in black /white to hide dirt and see how it went, because he is pic to shoes , always find any problem and don't like that drive us crazy . These are cute, but also functional, and very comfortable . Super lightweight which is the best , and most important thing, he love it and don't want to wear another shoe . I have washed them and put them in the dryer at least 4 times already. They are super easy to get on and off and they don't show dirt. I have been complimented on them several times. I will..."
"We have purchased these shoes for our littles many times before and loved them. They are so simple, and cute and go with everything. There is zero “break-in” time to be able to comfortably wear these. They are comfortable from the get go. No blisters, no problems. At the current price point, even if/when they wear them out, we can easily go get another pair and not feel guilty about spending $$$ on a name brand. We have gotten some more expensive name brand shoes, and my littles always request to wear these instead. You really can't go wrong with them. Definitely recommend and we will continue to purchase them."
These worked great for my almost 2 year old. The tongue pulled down far enough that they were easy to get on his feet (and most shoes are NOT easy to get on his feet). They seemed comfortable for him. They seem like they will last. Taking away one star because the soles are pretty stiff and will take a toddler a little longer to break them in.
"This sneaker was exactly what I needed for my toddler. The quality is good considering the price. I expect this shoe to stay in good condition long enough for 2 children to wear. My biggest problem with most toddler shoes is that they can be tight or hard to put on, but these are easy to put on my toddler."
My son had these for just over a week before the Velcro completely came off the side of the shoe. He can't wear them now they'll slip off. Waste of money.
"One day after the return window closed, the tongue came out of the shoe."
Son loves these but can't find them in his size anymore. Please sell more. He loves putting them on himself. Velcro came off with his last pair so we need another. Very comfortable for him.
I wanted something in black and actually to replace a black pair like this that fell apart in a week… the Velcro pulled off the shoe so no safe way to secure on toddler foot. Only three pair of size 12 boys to pick from. Price was fair as kids grow so fast. I do like the gray color and style.
"My preschooler doesn't care about name brands.  He wants comfy shoes.  These are perfect for him.  The velcro is coming off the backing on one shoe, but that wasn't a problem with the previous size, so it may be a one time issue.  I bought these because my son liked wearing the smaller size and he is a picky shoe wearer."
"Perfect! Love these shoes. Love the price even more, especially for quick growing toddler feet. My son loves that they look like big brothers fancy shoes"
My son loves these shoes so much we have bought them in multiple sizes.  They are easy to put on and take off.  They are reasonably priced and durable for  little boys that love to play outside.
"Nice and light, but still well-made. Perfect for toddlers still learning their footing. And $10? Can't beat that. Very pleased! Would buy again and would definitely recommend."
"Purchased for my 3 year old grandson, the shoes lasted almost three weeks.  (Jan 7-27) The velcro came a apart, shoes looked over all run down."
I bought these a week ago and the Velcro has already come apart. I guess I can super glue it back. The shoes shouldn't come apart after a week.
I like the ease of putting these shoes on my son. I like the simple black design. These are cheap and last my son months before wearing out.
"Velcro came off so the shoes do not close, therefore they cannot be worn! Horrible quality at a very fitting cost."
Absolutely love these shoes! Haven’t worn them yet to see how good the memory foam is or how long it’ll last or if they are even comfy but they look just like vans! And very true to size! 7 was a perfect fit on me!
Absolutely love these shoes! Haven’t worn them yet but they look good and comfy! They look just like vans!
"I loved everything! I am bartending and it is so hard to find a comfy cute shoe. I found this on clearance for $10 and knew I had nothing to lose. I wore them to work that day. An hour in and I was in love. I started bragging right away. As I was telling the other bartender she asked me if they were memory foam. I wasn’t sure and that’s when I looked in the sole and saw they were! I wore them 8 hours and my feet felt great. These shoes are a steal! Get yourself a pair! 

They fit me true to size 8"
"Super cute shoes AND memory foam. I don't know who the first person was to put memory foam in a shoe, but they were genius. I wanted a cute animal print shoe to wear throughout the winter and this is it. I did size down a 1/2 size since it was the last pair in the store. I thought it was going to be small - turns out it was just the right size. Don't you just love when that happens.  I would highly recommend because this print will go with so many things. Good shoe, Good price, Good day!"
"These shoes are true to size and comfortable. This is the second pair that I’ve owned. They are more expensive online, so if you can find it in store, buy it there."
"I needed white slip-on shoes, but I didn't feel like paying $20 for a pair that gets dirty in 2 months or less. These just came in today, and I am obsessed:-) They fit accordingly to my foot size and are perfect either for work shoes or everyday wear. The soles are thick but not clunky or heavy. I have wide feet and high arches, but they slip evenly, and the shoes go with my summer fashion wears. No tears when it came in, and the material was as expected for a canvas shoe. No Boundaries slip-on shoes are an ideal substitute for white vans. Highly recommend!!!"
"This is my 3rd pair of No Boundaries pull-ons, I'm only disappointed that I can't get pink!  SEE!  I wore a hole in the toe of these!  I wanted to get several pairs in other colors, where can I get those?  They are so easy to put on and wear all day!  I'm 75 and finally have pain-free feet!  Please tell me where to get colors in a size 8!  Love these shoes!"
I like the look and feel of these shoes. The white color is good. The shoes don’t open at the side when I walk. They’re not to tight or to loose. They fit just right.
"Ordered 2 pairs and both arrived with mold, so I re-ordered another 2 pairs to replace the first 2, nope the second set had worst mold then the first two pair. Returning."
it had a scruff mark in the back
At first I thought they were going to be too small but after using a shoe horn my foot slid right in.  They are very comfortable and will not slide off my feet. I would like to know if they are machine washable since I didn't see that when I bought them. If anybody knows the answer just add it to your review
My daughter made these with sharpie markers and rubbing alcohol- I love them!
"Bought these for my wife. Though she just got them the shoes seems OK so we will see with time. Problem is they are selling for $16.98 on walmart.com, received the shoes with a tag on them that said $14.97."
"I love the look and the comfort of this shoe. I wore them for over 10 hours with no issues. Also, they were on clearance. Thank you Walmart"
The right shoe is impossible to wear.....I have put heal reinforcements in the back but I cannot wear for it slipping
The uppers are stiff and (for my use) will require breaking in.  They fit and are comfortable with socks.
I ordered these and received them really fast but they were covered in mold when I opened the package and stunk like a wet towel that had been left in a bag
Fit well and they are comfortable.
just like the vans perfect fit and comfy
I am not a fan of these shoes. They make my feet look really big.
"These And1 basketball shoes would be a great addition to any shoe closet. Not only do they have a stylish look but they have a great fit. The white/black color scheme looks good with any type of clothing from a uniform to a casual sundress. I like the low top of the shoe. I feel like my foot is supported but also can breathe, less worry of a sweaty foot. The shoes go on with ease and stay on with the laces snug or loose. The tongue is thick so it would protect the top of the foot a bit. The shoe is very comfortable. My toes do not feel squished. The heel area of the shoe is soft but strong. There is no worry about blisters. The sole is thick enough to give cushion but not so thick that it feels like you are walking on something besides the ..."
"I just love my And1 Ignite Low Women's Basketball Shoe Size 6! They are comfortable, durable, well made and provide the support I need for work or play. I got a black and white scheme for mine, which goes with everything. 

I have shown and recommended my And1 Ignite Low Women's Basketball Shoe Size 6 to my friends and family and will keep And1 Ignite Low Women's Basketball Shoe on my shopping list"
I really like these And1 Ignite Low Women's Basketball Shoes! They're really soft and comfortable! I was really impressed to see how comfortable they were as I walked around in them!
"And1 Ignite Low Women's Basketball Shoe - these are cute shoes, black and white with black laces and black sole. They are pretty heavy and the sole is solid, the inside is not very cushiony so not sure I would want to wear these for an extended period of time. True to size, I normally wear an 8 in other brands and these fit well with plenty of room in the toe box."
I received the And 1 Ignite Low Womens Basketball shoe in size 9 and the shoes are a nice quality shoe. I used the shoe for walking and working out and the shoe was durable and sturdy. One thing about the shoe is they are a little tight around the toe area. Other than that the shoe was a nice addition to my workout wardrobe. I really like the color.
I have two problems with these shoes. I do wear a 7 but this size 7 is too tight. Also I need arch support and these don't have that. They are flat. It's a nice looking shoe and I'm sorry I can't wear them. Even if they weren't too tight I wouldn't be wearing them due to no arch support. So if you need that this shoe is not for you.
"These shoes are really
stylishly designed and seem to be made
out of tough materials. They are true to 
sizing. They don't leave marks on the
floor. The soles are very stiff."
this pair looks and feels more like an athletic fashion shoe rather than a pair that you will use to play basketball. it is true to size. not very comfy. and the soles feel slippery. it is something i will use for everyday errands.
"These shoes have a cute classic look, but they are not very comfortable. I would wear them for just a bit before needing to take them off due to leaving blisters at my ankles. I definitely wouldn’t recommend playing basketball ball in them. They offer no ankle support at all."
Not so comfortable.  Temporary shoes for a day or so. Personally I didn't find these shoes comfortable at all. They fit a little snug for my regular size feet. They are meant for skinny feet. I'm a size 8.5 women and these are a size 9 women.  It smashed up front a little.  I like a lose fit. These are not for me. I can tell they would losen over time. These would definitely blister my feet. No thank you.
"Came dirty, run small. Felt cheap. Almost like I could easily rip the tongue out of the shoe."
These are fabulous dupes for low dunks and so comfortable. Almost memory foam feeling soles. Extremely good shape and seem pretty well made for the price. I bought black and went back to buy the blue. Look incredible with the current wide/90s jeans trend.
I really like these shoes and they are perfect for athletics or just walking. They are really comfortable and fit wide feet without feeling snug. I like the black and white pattern and they are really high quality. These are comfortable to walk and run in and something I recommend.
I bought these shoes brand new at my local Walmart and I love and1s their my favorite I’ve owned almost all designs so buy these and I’ve worn them twice and the bottoms are falling off
I have the name brand of this version and in my opinion this dupe which isn't a replica because it does not have the actual logo that this shoe resembles is much more comfortable.
I love these sneakers! They are a perfect dupe for the popular black and white Nikes but for a much cheaper price. I originally bought them half a size bigger bc I’m usually a 9 in sneakers and had to return them but an 8.5 fits perfectly! I wouldn’t wear them for a HITT workout but for walking and every day sneakers they’re perfect!
"Love this sneaker. Great price, comfortable and cute. Not sure if they last but for the price can't go wrong.
Bought two colors, true to size."
"I think these are a great dupe for the Nike dunks! My only dislike is that they are a little stiff, the sole doesn’t flex, but still pretty comfortable."
The tie area already showing wesr
"These were really narrow, and felt clunky and inflexible on"
My teenager was thrilled when I gifted him these shoes! It's hard to find shoes like this in men's sizes. I got the size 6 for my son. The fit was spot on and my son said the shoes are really comfortable. He's worn them almost everyday over the past 3 weeks. They seem to be holding up nicely.
"Love these, finally just basic pokemon! Comfortable and bright, not bad for price, esp. with a licensed product."
"great shoe. my son loves them but i seen alot of reviews saying they run small, to size up. so i did that and they are way too big. just wanted to put that out there."
cute and makes good birthday gift for kids.
My 5yr old loves them. He said that the colors remind him of rainbows.
Wow these are so full of colors and a variety of pokémon . very easy to slip on perfect for something easy and fast to wear. very comfortable and fit perfect .
"They came quickly, size is true to fit, great shoe for value."
I bought them for my grandson. He was so excited to get them.
big compared to similar sizes
"my son is a sz 13, we ordered a 13 and its too small. must run smaller"
my kiddo wears a 1.5 so i thought a size 2 would fit well. the size 2 didnt even have room to get the whole foot in. pretty disappointed and have a very disappointed kid. going to order the size 4 in hopes they fit.
These are cute but run small so you might need to order a size up
My 9 year old grandson loves these! Very vibrant colors!
My grandson has special needs and it's hard to find shoes for boys that want slip on shoes plus I am raising both the my twin grandsons so money it tight and trying to find shoes  that doesn't cost millions.
My 7yr old daughter is a big Pokemon fan. She loved her shoes good quality for the price.
I went off a review they ran small so I sized up. Unfortunately the shoes are too big.
they run a little small. I thought it’d be fine cause we just sized up but they still were too tight
The Pokémon tennis shoes are super cute! My grandson loved them!
I love this foundation!!!! I am 46 and this has really brought some life to my face. It's not too heavy and it's very moisturizing. Lasts all day.  I absolutely love it!
amazing product for evening skin and brightening tone without looking like you have a shell of makeup on your face
Fantastic.Blends beautifully very natural looking.Perfect for everyday natural looking coverage.I have a really expensive skin tint but this is better.Great formula
A little bit yellow but on a skin it looks really good… great for mature skin
This is a good product for running around doing errands. It provides light coverage without it feeling or looking like you have anything on at all. I wouldn't use it for going out or special occasions.
"light coverage, great for warmer weather days!"
"Well, the first couple times I tried this it stuck to each little flake and texture on my face. I then did a good exfoliation and moisture for a couple days and tried again. I like it! The foundation is very lightweight, comfortable and makes my skin look good!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used this product over the past weekend.  The tint is not in line for women of color. I thought the tint looked washed out and pasty. I received the color for deep and while the coverage was good the color was way off.  Almost like the foundation my grandmother use to wear.
Greasy feeling; not in a good way. But the color-matching is perfect so I will mix with other foundations. Super tiny. Almost like a concealer size.
"I was very disappointed in coverage.  It just disappeared when put on.  Very thin consistency. 
Bobbi Brown was recommending this product on social media.  I thought she knew a lot about makeup."
"This stuff goes on smooth and provides a soft, light cover. Not too heavy.  Be sure to get the right shade. 
Highly recommend for mature skin tones."
"If you want a very light affect both in coverage and in feel, then this is for you.  Even if you wear heavier makeup normally as I do, I enjoyed having this as a simple coverup to go out and run errands during the hot summer time."
Perfect foundation for mature skin. Melts into the skin leaving a beautiful skin like finish. Minimizes pores and blurs texture. Best applied with fingers then refined with a damp beauty sponge if needed. Definitely will be repurchasing.
Smooth as butter application- feels great and hydrating on skin! Great for summer!!
"Good coverage, will buy again"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My perfect skin in a jar. It's smooth, creamy, and melts in my skin. A little goes a long way. My face looked younger and skin looked refreshed. My husband said what did you do? I said I've been drinking alot of water until it was time to take the foundation off, LOL. It was easy to take off. It lasted all day. No cracks, no runs. Hid all my dark spots. It gave me glowing skin."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really love this. It's very light and goes on like satin. It's a light coverage which is exactly what I wanted. It doesn't crepe and makes my skin so soft. I used my fingers to apply and it worked perfectly. I definitely recommend if you're looking for a light smoothing coverage. I've added a before and after photo.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently started using this 4 in 1 tinted Balm.  It is a medium color and comes in a round glass jar. I just use my finger to apply and spread on my face. It smoothes the age lines and does a great job covering over my age spots. It applies evenly and lasts all day. The jar is small enough to fit in a wristlet for reapplying hours later.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Thai tinted balm is wonderful and goes on smooth and easy. It gives full coverage and looks so natural. The coverage lasted all day and I didn't break out from the product even though I have sensitive skin. I just wish it came a shade darker for women of color.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] How does this product compare to other products you've tried?  It's very light weight, an airy whipped texture.
What are some benefits of owning this product? This balm foundation is build-able. 
Would you buy this product? Yes
Would you recommend this product to your friends or family? Yes as this can be used alone, with concealer, or with full coverage foundation over it."
"I have used this gel for a while now , i use it for my lashes as a primer before i use mascara . It helps them be elongated and separated. I use it daily for my brows if i want a brushed tamed look without pencil & i use it with my brow pencil as well to finish off my eyebrow look"
Great clear brow mascara i love that its clear with no color Goes on easy and stay power last all day/
They really shine and go anywhere you want with out them looking sloppy
"Awesome product, I use it daily. I put it on first then paint my brows. If it's super hot outside I put on a small extra layer on top just in case. Only concern is that with daily use it can run out quick but they have the 2 pack now so good move by ELF."
My daughter loves this mascara. It enhances her lashes and seals her brows looking more natural. This way she avoids regular makeup and feels herself.
I use the clear mascara as a mascara primer and it works wonderfully. It thickens and lengthens my lashes perfectly.
Used this to keep my eyebrows shaped. Works well. Dries clear and not visible. Doesn't dry hard either but holds. Can't beat the price.
"i LOVE the eyebrow gel, it holds my brows in place without making them look wet or greasy which i love. the mascara is good as well but i mainly bought it for the eyebrow gel so i don’t really use it."
This mascara is perfect for sports I bought it for my daughter she is in basketball and her face sweats. This mascara allows her play and look beautiful at the same time.
It was ok - worked but I felt like it had a slightly unpleasant smell
I really love it it's a great brow gel and a clear mascara would definitely recommend it!
"Fast delivery. Heads up if you opt for home delivery it comes via door dash after the fact via email. If it wasn't for our RING we wouldn't had even known it was delivered at all unless your one to check your emails frequently throughout the day. Otherwise, I did get my order."
I use this before or after filling my brows to keep them in place. A light touch is required so it doesn’t dry to a crusty look. I also like to coat my stick-straight eyelashes with this gel and let them dry before curling and applying mascara because they seem to hold the curl longer that way.
This item made absolutely no difference on and off my eyes or brows. No difference! This item is one of many ELF items I will never buy again!
It left white stuff on my brows and lashes. I really wanted to like this but I have dark hair so the white residue is really noticeable on me.
I love how it works on my brows but I do not recommend using it on your lashes!
"It doesn't hold brows at all, waste of money."
I don't wear black mascara so I love the clear. I get the definition and curl without the messy blackness around my eyes.
i bought this a few weeks ago and the eyebrow gel feels very light and holds your eyebrows for a long time but the lash gel doesn’t hold them t your lashes for very long at all.
"I am truly late when it comes to this product. I’ve heard about this for years and never tried it, but I’ve recently purchased this and loved it. From here on out this is most definitely going to be something I’m going to continue to purchase."
"I use this almost daily for combing lashes,"
works well for my husbands bushy eyebrows
Works great! Makes brows look fuller.
"Love shopping from home! Especially now with social distancing. I feel like when I order from Walmart they seem to have what I need plus it gets here in perfect timing.

Thank you,
Michelle from Oregon"
"This is a very nice item.  It is for my husband so he can trim his eyebrows.  He likes the long handle.  I might be getting one for myself, as my short handle one is getting harder and harder for older hands to hold onto."
Love this thing! Versatile and I use for brows  and eyelashes!
This works well and it is not expensive.  Most brushes are at least twice the price and more and it all functions in the same way.
I liked how it brushed out my eyebrows but I thought it was going to separate my lashes better but it didn't go that well. But I do really like it.
"Did not get this, I guess it blew away cuz it was real windy yesterday. Was home all evening too."
This broke the minute I started using it.
Great eyebrow brush and great value
You literally cannot find these things anywhere anymore thank you thank you thank you I needed it so much
"Its great. I use lotion to help keep my eyebrows up. My eyebrows are thick and dense in the middle so, it takes time. Thanks."
I don't do a lot of makeup but always do my mascara. I got two of these brushes and it works so well!! It separates my lashes well and helps to declump my mascara it out goes clumpy. Plus you can't beat the price!
"I like the price and the variety of ways that the brush/comb can be used, i.e brows, lashes, hair line.  I bought this one for my husband to use on his facial hair.
I’ve purchased this item before and it is very substantial and useful."
I find this to be the best eyelash comb that I've used. Sturdy and does the job.
this item works so well and especially if you use clear eye brows gell with it!
The comb part works well to separate my lashes and thats what I needed!
I don't like the curve in the eyelash comb. It makes it harder for me to use.
Exactly what I needed and at a great price.
"Formula is set up to be just like high end brands, last all day plus more (sad to say I slept in it) the dewy finish really gives the moisturizer look and the matte is beyond matte both textures are amazing and perfectly balanced. I do mix some shades for a better shade for myself. So pro tips if you can't find your shade get a darker one with a lighter one matching your undertones for a perfect shade. Apply with sponge beauty blender, mix on back of hand, after you squeeze the water out of sponge dab onto product then face for a even coverage, I use the sponge from dollar tree the beauty blender dupe works just the same for only $1.25 compared to $22 at ultra! Apply more product where needed or for more full coverage set with translucent l..."
I just ordered this foundation and used for the first time today. I am very impressed with the color match with my complexion. Coverage is pretty good. It doesn't feel heavy and I did not use any powder to set. I will absolutely continue to buy this foundation!
Love this foundation!! Best coverage and lasts all day!!
I started using the satin foundation in alabaster about a week ago and it's my new favorite! Finally a foundation with the right pink undertones for my skin. I'm 57 years old and the picture is in natural outdoor light.
I have tried every foundation from high-end to low-end makeup and this is the only one that has worked for my combination skin. I cannot even begin to gush over this very light to buildable coverage foundation! The scent isn't too strong either!!!
"I've been on the hunt for a good foundation for my skin type. I had never tried e.l.f cosmetics before, but always see posts about their products, great reviews, etc. I also had a friend recommend I give it a try. I actually love this foundation. It goes on nice, easy, and smooth, without feeling too heavy on my skin. The light ivory was the perfect shade for me, other products light ivory is way to light. This lasted all day, without needing touch ups, and looked fabulous on my skin. It was easy to wash off as well. I can't wait to try tons more of products from the e.l.f line, I'm impressed!!!!"
"I have been using this foundation for over a year. I was a Clinique client and changed after using this for a month. The quality is very similar to the Clinique and I just love the savings. May I add; I am 71 years old with good skin, this make it look even better. Thanks ELF!"
"I'm at that age...you know...over sixty...the age no one talks about?  It's difficult to find a foundation that doesn't look caked on and accentuates my lines.  This product achieves all of what I need.  TY E.L.F.  BTW, in this photo I also used the Putty Primer before the foundation and the Poreless powder on top."
"I have tried all of E.L.F foundations and Tinted moisturizers in deep tones and they all are epic false for me. They are either too red or too ashy in the under tones Almond, Coffee and Expresso can not be the end. Every black person does not have tge same skin tone in deep lol and for use combination/oily girls you guys have to fix the  matte finish because its a no bueano for foundation products. You have to do better guys, I'm still a loyal customers but your foundations and Tinted Moisturizer in deep tones have got to do better. Lol"
"I bought the elf foundation in almond after doing a side by side comparison of the shade next to the foundation I normally use because I was looking for something less expensive. The foundation looks awful on mixed skin though. I went through three different shade pickers to make sure I hadn't just picked the wrong foundation color and I didn't something about the foundation just makes it look awful with flash .Without flash it is ok but, it makes you look sallow and the foundation has absolutely no coverage."
"This is the best foundation I've ever used. Ever! It's a dupe for MAC studio fix fluid and is similar coverage of loreal true match. It does go on quite thick I.e. It's not a light foundation but I like the feel of it. It's very moisturizing and feels nourishing. This foundation needs to be set with a powder and touched up 1-2 times throughout the day. I have fair to medium skin and am MAC nw25 Buff is the best match for me but I also have sand and caramel which I like to mix together to get a shade darker than buff for summertime.
I can't believe how cheap this product is!!!!!"
"First I got this in sand and my neck has a yellow undertone, this foundation seem to have a pink to it and it was a little lighter than my skin color. I bought another one in buff and it was waaaay to dark. I might try porcelain and see how it goes and if it's too light and pink then I'll just blend sand or porcelain with buff."
"I waited until I had been using this for a while to writw a review. I wanted to be sure and I am. I am halfway through my 2nd bottle. This foundation is amazing. The Natural (Porcelain) shade fits me perfectly, undertones and all. I tend to run red and have some discoloration and it covers it all so nicely. I do pair it witb e.l.f. ,concealer (the large tube not the small tube with the wand) seriously the best combo! I would recommend this to anyone. Its like a high end foundation for a 1/8- 1/4 of the price!"
Suede is a perfect match for me. It's a natural skin like finish. Be sure to prep your skin before applying foundation and setting it afterwards. It really makes a difference when you prep and set! I apply with a damp makeup sponge and it leaves the foundation looking airbrushed. I used the flawless finish concealers in tan sand and deep olive. I love it!!
"My daughter gave me a bottle of Porcelain  Flawless Finish. Finally a foundation I like....or so I thought. I bought a bottle that was labeled ""same color new name"" ""previously Porcelain"".  It's NOT SAME color, it was much lighter. I went to another store and bought their last bottle still labeled Porcelain and it's like the origInal color. I like its coverage and love the pump bottle. Please bring back the original Porcelain color."
"I have mature, dry skin that requires a satin and/or Dewy finish Foundation. Initially, I purchased ELF FLAWLESS FINISH FOUNDATION in COCO. I loved your formulation, but I was making do with the shade as heretofore, Elf did not offer exactly what my complexion needed. NOW YOU DO! The shades that you have added for Women of Color are excellent. I ordered three new Shades, two are useful for my Daughter and a friend,  and NUTMEG is perfect for me. I am including a selfie with ne wearing Elf Flawless Finish Foundation in NUTMEG. (I can utilize the past purchase, COCO as my Summer Shade)....I also find that this Foundation applies smoothly with a sponge or a brush, and wears a long time. (I do use a hydrating primer under it, reiterating that m..."
"I am so glad I decided to give this foundation a chance. My skin tone is naturally a little yellow and therefore have problems with foundations being too pink. I enjoy the way it feels on my face. I have naturally oily skin and I find it's a great fit. It covers my acne nicely, stays on all day, goes on thick but does not clog my pores. I love the functionality of the bottle and that it has a squeeze top. I purchased my first bottle in December and have already gone through that. LOVE THIS!!! * Side note: I have gotten compliments on how flawless my makeup application is.. I use elf brushes, foundation, bronzer, & blush."
"I have never written a makeup review. I had to for this. I've tried about 10 foundations over the last year trying to find one to cover my breastfeeding melasma and my huge pores. 

This is perfect! I used it with a Beauty blender after elf primer and I'm thrilled with the results. 

It was a complete steal during the half off sale. I'll be sure to stock up next time."
"I have extremely fair, extremely sensitive, combination skin. I have NEVER found a foundation that doesn't burn, goes on as smoothly, and doesn't make my face break out- Until e.l.f. Flawless Finish Foundation. Looks natural, feels natural, long-wear. Perfection!"
"In the picture below I'm wearing this foundation, as well as an Elf blush and bronzer duo, Elf setting powder, Elf lipstick, and Elf brow pencil. I'm definitely a fan! I used the shade matcher to figure out which shade to buy and when it first arrived I thought maybe it looked too dark (I got “snow”) but it blended out perfectly. I love how this foundation still looks like skin while providing a perfect amount of coverage."
"I love the color story of this little palette, the pigmentation is really good and I think it will work so much better with a white eyeshadow primer or concealer!"
"Definitely one of Profusion's finest works! The mattes here look and feel expensive, they are so finely milled they are almost creamy. Everything blends beautifully, the fallout is minimal and the colors are true to pan with medium to full coverage. Everything you need to make a complete look is here and you won't have to reach for another palette to get things done. You can make subtle daytime looks or go gaudy like I did, there is enough shade range to do whatever you intend and do so seamlessly. 

My only complaint is the shade ""Frostbite"" it is very sheer and starts to muddy and fade after about 6 hours on my hooded eyes as well as collect on my lashes. The rest of the colors stay put all day and all night with any of Profusion's eyes..."
"These are so beautiful, the mattes are divine and the shimmers are frost-like. I'm just a little sad that they oxidize after about 3 hours to a more reddish hue, they started out as cool toned genuine mauve then became more amaranth as the day went on. Still beautiful even after the oxidation set in. The shades I used in my photos are ""Femme"", ""Kindly"", ""Explode"", ""Ballad"" and ""Monsoon"" shown approximately 10 hours after application and completely oxidized.

Rated the formula 3/5 because of the oxidation which i was deeply disappointed with is so drastically profound it doesn't look even remotely like the mauve it starts out as. It's wear, payoff and bendablity are 5/5!"
Love the colors
I ordered this pallette from WM.com. it came crushed. Not one single square was salvageable. Awesome return policy. Got another and two of the squares were broken. So I can't give an accurate answer. I like what I have.
"It came almost completely destroyed, the colours them selfs are good, but i wish i had received it not already obliterated.  Only five made it, the eyeshadows are nice but i wouldn't recommend buying it here. Not worth my money honestly."
"These palettes, while apparently great from reviews on YouTube, came completely shattered. I ordered two (the Emeralds and Violets) which came in a regular padded envelope and were completely covered in broken, mixed pigment where the palettes had broken open. In one palette, 2 were completely gone and in the other 4 were. Unfortunately, my local Walmart doesn't carry these so ordering was my only option. I don't recommend purchasing these online."

Recently purchased fuchsia eyeshadow. Delivered however upon opening the box it was all over inside the package. I suggest eyeshadow or some powder products be wrapped individually. Other than that everything came quicker than I anticipated.
horrible i can't believe this I got this as a birthday gift for my girlfriend and it showed up like this I want my money back!!! HORRIBLE!!
"I purchased the Mauve palette and absolutely am in love with all of the shades. You don't need to use very much to get a gorgeous play of color and the colors are excellent for many skin tones. I also love that there are 5 matte colors and 5 shimmery colors. The shimmer is beautiful and not overly flashy. You can mix different colors together to make lots of different looks. You can use the creamy white lighter color as a highlighter. I use this palette as a blush also, as many of the pink/mauve shades are gorgeous on the cheeks! I have extremely sensitive skin and this or doesn't bother me at all. What an amazing buy! This palette is so multi-use for me that it's become my favorite one! Not to mention it is super affordable! I am so happy ..."
"So pigmented and beautiful, the best ultramarine eyeshadow I have ever used! You can do the most beautiful royal blue smoky eye with just this one palette! Love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!"
This stuff is so pretty and bright
Two of the colors are not on the palette
"Pallet was broken, makeup all over the package"
Package interior was broken. Outside was covered in product. :(
Love these!  I have most of these palettes.  They are amazing! The fuchsia %26 emeralds are particularly gorgeous.  Better than high-end palettes.  wish they were in my local stores.
"I've had this palette about 3 days now and I love it 
It's very pigmented and the colors blend pretty well plus for the price it's great 
I do wish the yellow was a little brighter? I was looking for idk banana but it's more of a sunflower  but it's still pretty"
"I bought the Emeralds palette because the combination of the green shades with some warm neutrals really intrigued me! I usually wear neutral eyeshadows, but I decided to give this a try. I really appreciate how the entire palette isn't full of green and includes a few neutral shades to ""ground"" the look and make it more wearable. The matte shadows blend well and the glitter/metallic shades are stunning! The shadows are very well pigmented and true to color in the pan. Also, the greens don't muddy together and blend very well together. However, these eyeshadows are quite powdery and you will get a lot of fallout underneath your eyes. Therefore, I would recommend doing your eyes first before the rest of your face. For a palette under $5 this..."
"It is not blendable, buildable, or pigmented. I even used it with and without primer. I bought it cause of good reviews, but i guess the neon is just a flop."
"Works well for me.  I didn't have any problems with the tip breaking off like other reviews mention.  You do not need to extend the tip out very far to use it, and you don't need to apply a lot of pressure.  Just short, light strokes to layer it on.  Nice color for me because I have very dark brown brows.  The brush is good quality."
Best pencil for filling in thin brows. Taupe is perfect color for brunettes or light hair. It's as good or better than MAC lingering and at least half the price.
"This is a great alternative to the more expensive brow DEFINERS. It's got a very fine, precise tip and it's very comparable to the ABH brow wiz. The shades are not exactly the same, but I have blonde, light brown brows and I can make the taupe shade work. It's ashy though."
Wow who would think a drugstore product would work better than high end?   Well Elf did it with this brow item.   Its out of the park AMAZING!!!   This pencil took over my ABH brow pencil and Ill never go back.
My favorite for eyebrows and affordable!
"i was buying the Anastasia one for so long. it's 4 times the price.  this is just as good, it's my favorite."
I have used this product many times and like it and the Walmart price.
The pencil is thin enough to do hair-like strokes %26 taupe is a good color for me.
Did not realize how thin the pencil is. But will work with it. My color is great.
color was off and product hard
nice thin pencil color works for me
"Works sooo well and leaves a beautiful, natural finish if you use small strokes. I only have it 4 stars because I go through it too fast and have to buy another more often than I’d like, but it is cheap so that helps."
"Love this pencil, it's a constant repurchase for me"
I love the affordability %26 coverage of this brow pencil
Love the precision but the pencil is so thin it breaks really easily
"Great brow pencil. I have tried lots of brands, this is my favorite so far."
I love this brow pencil. It's so thin and makes a great mark that blends and feathers easily with the attached brush.
"My eyebrows have become very thin and this product fills in and makes them look natural. 
Color taupe is perfect."
I love this tool!  I am older and have disappearing eyebrows and this tool helped me get my eyebrows back without making them look fake.
This is best brow pencil I've ever used. It definitely is precise and so easy to use. The small point glides when filling in sparse hairs and is so easy to outline. The spooly helps blend and set hairs in place.
"I loved its texture and the long lasting glow because of materials used to make it is very soothing and enhance my lips skin, very soft natural and genuine beauty product that cares for the customers real need."
This lipstick doesn't feel sticky or heavy on my lips. It's actually applies very smoothly. Its creamy and feels like I batwly have anything on. I am African American and medium-brown in complexion. This shade looks like a dark pink on me and I love it. It's an everyday shade that I can wear often. It lasts long as well. I would recommend this.
"This is a subtle color and it goes with everything! I can put it on with whatever I am wearing, it is a nice subtle color, a perfect blend. I will use all of this product then will purchase more of the same to always have on hand. This brand will be my go to brand for this product and I am sure I will find many more lipstick colors that I will be able to wear. I found my subtle look now I need to find that noticeable stand out look with this brand that I am confident they will have . 
This makes it easier to purchase their line of cosmetics without having to second guess, period. I always look for that one brand that works for me, when I do I find that one it is the first go to brand I will always use, the one I really like, my go to brand..."
"I really love this lipstick. Moist, smooth, love the color. it is just right for me. Enjoy using it and would definetly recommed it for anyone wanting a hot pink lipstick that is moist and goes on smoothly. Stays on long too. Easy to spread on and goes on well at my 'points' on upper lip."
"Wow. Beautiful color. I have pale skin and it looks wonderful on me. Silky smooth. Stays on all day. Makes my lips feel so soft and smooth. I can't wait to wear it out with friends. Even if it wears off a little, the color stains your lips leaving a pretty color. I will definitely be picking up other colors. I don't have many lipsticks, I usually find a color or brand and stick with it."
"Don't let the color fool you...yes it looks extremely dark...but it actually isn't...This Revlon lipstick is very creamy, not matte...The color is a nice subtle violet...I will admit when I opened it, I was thinking I would never wear this dark lipstick...since I normally wear pink/nude lipsticks but trust me, the color is beautiful...I definitely see myself wearing this lipstick, more for a night out..."
"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick Naughty Plum lipstick is a very smooth, very luxurious lipstick with a nice color. Unfortunately, if a woman has thin lips, it does not look appealing. This is a product and color for young women whose lips are still young and full. I recommend it to women who are under 40 years of age."
"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick Naughty Plum, 0.15 oz has a creamy texture and a mahogany look. I liked this color on me (red hair, pale complexion)- for a pale complexion the ""plum"" is not too red. For those of us that like to wear darker lip colors but cannot really pull of the reds, this is a nice compromise. It is fairly long lasting and does not need more than one coat to look good. The color does not run and my lips do not feel dried out when I use this. The product goes on smoothly. The top of the tube is clear so you can see the color of the stick rather than just rely on the sticker on the bottom. The stick of product rolls up and down easily and the end comes to a rounded point making upper lip application easy. The top does not co..."
"This lipstick has a gorgeous color that goes on smooth and starts off strong. Gives a nice full luxurious smile. Perfect lipstick to put on just before a photo op or apply before a meeting. Does not last more then 20 minutes before requiring you to reapply. If you eat, drink, or kiss during that time, it instantly comes off. Love the color and carry it around throughout the day to be able to reapply often."
"I won’t be using this for hygiene reasons. I bought a few lipsticks but two of them were from the same line. As you can see from the first picture below, only the one on the left is sealed with plastic. Upon opening the unsealed one, it didn’t look smooth and shiny like new but looked like it had been touched, with smudges on the top. Very disappointed as I had the lot delivered in Florida and had my mom bring them over to me in Singapore. Obviously I can’t exchange it for another. :( 
See if I can get a refund."
"I absolutely love this product. The color is a natural beautiful
color. I have very pale skin so this is perfect fit every day wear. 
It goes in smoothly and evenly. It is not sticky at all. It feels very 
Light like chap stick. It isn't long wearing but I do not mind reapplying
through out my day. The long wearing tends to dry my lips out so
For me this formula works out better for me."
I love this color (Mink #671) if you want a very natural (little or no makeup) look then you may really like this color. These are my favorite lipsticks of all time; they are super creamy and for such a reasonable price you can not beat it. This mink creme goes a long way and lasts for months I have been searching for the perfect color for everyday use and I finally found it. I own a total of ten of these super lustrous lipsticks and I just hope they don't ever get discontinued.Awesome product!
"I absolutely love Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick! The color is beautiful, it glides on, taste is pleasant on my lips and the case looks sleek and classy. I’ve been looking for a lipstick that I really like with all of those features, I’m so glad I tried this one! I would definitely recommend to my friends and family. Can’t wait to try more colors. Thank you Revlon!"
What a great value for under $7! My husband's favorite color is Midnight Mystery since he likes when I wear all black.
"Revlon,is known for it's moisturizing lipsticks.The,shade mink is beyond beautiful.I,love this shade..perfect neutral shade."
"this lipstick goes on very smoothly. the color is Naughty Plum so I was excited to try this, as any Plum color is great for me. But, it is just too dark for me. It does go on very smoothly and I would recommend to my friends that wear the browns, dk plums in lipstick. Very easy to put on and very moist.
The pictures don't show the real color, as the pictures show a very nice 'mauve' color, but in true life, the color is more brownish/dk plum."
I am a Spark Reviewer for Walmart and was sent a free tube of Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick 0.15 oz in color 044 Bare Affair to review. The tube itself is a heavy duty tube that pulls open and closed. It closes nicely and seems to stay closed even when in your bag or purse. The lipstick tube is your standard twist up with about 1 1/2 inches of lipstick in the tube. The case is black in color with a pretty gold band in the center making it a nice addition to your makeup. It has a clear plastic window at the top of the tube that makes it easy to see what color you have without having to open it up first. The lipstick glides on with almost a creamy feel to it so it goes on smooth with no pulling to your lips. The 044 Bare Affair is a very neu...
"This is not the sort of lipstick that you can put on and simply forget about it. Everytime I put it on, it settles into the creases of my skin. Otherwise, love the color and softness of the lipstick. It could be that I just don't know how to apply lipstick. I am certainly no pro."
"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick .044 Bare Affair is a very nice lipstick. The color is a neutral color for those who just want a hint of color, hence the name Bare Affair. It has a nice feel to it, but could use a little more moisture. It is a bit too dry. It does roll on nicely however. I love the color. It adds a little brown to the pinkness of lips. The lips show up more than a clear color. It does not have a high shine to it. It is a more solid lipstick and shows up nicely without being overly shiny. Very nice. I would recommend this lipstick to any woman wanting a good lipstick. And it comes in many other colors besides my favorite, Bare Affair."
"I love Revlon, and have used their lipsticks for so many years. I really love this new lipstick; it goes on so smoothly and really moisturizes my lips. I have fairly long hair and I love how the lipstick feels so rich and creamy, yet my hair doesn't get stuck on my lips in a breeze like some other brands.
The lipstick glides on so smoothly, and I didn't have to reapply for a few hours. There's no waxy, greasy, thick feeling on your lips. This lipstick moisturizes your lips, without feeling waxy or greasy.
I tried this on my friend who has naturally dark pink lips, and this toned the pink down, and softened her lips.
I can't wait to try some of the other colors."
I have tried about 10 different eyebrow pencils and this elf neutral brown is my favorite. I have sparse brows - in my early 60's now and they have become thinner. So inexpensive and the easiest pencil to use.
"Good product, competitive price. Great packaging provided by manufacturer; 
this product's package is self contained and not just wrapped in a piece of plastic wrap (which invariably is subject to being opened in the store, used and then placed back on the shelf for sale}."
"Love these eye pencils I use them at least 6 days a week they are easy to use and wipes off
Quickly with makeup remover or just a warm
Wet paper towel the price is great compared to some of the other brand name products I think I get at least 3 weeks or more of use from
This item"
"These Elf brow pencils are an excellent product.  The price is much more reasonable than some of the well-known brands, and the product is just as good.  A great value!  I like the neutral brown color, too."
This is my 3rd purchase of instant brow lift pencil. It's the best brow pencil I've found yet. It defines & fills out my thinning brows in a very natural way & stays in place all day w/o needing to put gel over it to hold my brows in place. This product is a holy grail for me
I like the pencil very much.This is the third set I bought.
Such a nice pencil. Especially the price
why pay more when you can get great results with affordable items. This is a fav in my house!
"I use the taupe color and love it! I have used this product religiously for about 3 years. The pencil size allows for precise placement, holds even when worn lightly, and is the perfect consistency for normal skin. If you are more oily, add a translucent setting powder or brow powder over the top. I love the price of this product too. It doesn't compare to other drug store brand products!"
"Decent wear duration, applies easy. I usually blend it out with a cotton ball after combing through it to make it look more natural on the inner parts of my brow."
It wasn't the same as the single elf brown pencils. Less pigment and breaks easily.
I just used it and it filled in my missing over-plucked areas great.
"Bought lighter shade, blends nicely into existing brow"
"easy to use, great coverage, great value, lasts all day"
I've been using these brow pencils for years. They work great and blend in well with my natural lashes. I just use it to fill in thin spots. It's great that they don't need sharpened. I haven't felt the need to change to a more expensive pencil. This is a bargain but it's not cheap.
"i love this eyebrow pencil. it's super easy to use, super pigmented on my nonexistent brows, really nice brush too. i highly recommend this to ppl with bushy and blonde eyebrows"
"I'm almost at the end of one and about to start the next! So thin and quick to draw on yet they still last a good few months each, only wish there was a lighter / cooler shade available"
"I use it just about every day!  I like it.  I have been using your brow stuff for a while.  I used another kind, the one in the black container with the powder-like and liquid-like!"
"I really love these eyebrow pencils, very well priced and super quality, I have the taupe shade, it goes on well, and looks nice, not too dark as I am a blonde, never go back to any other brand now, very happy indeed."
I've  used these pencils for years and they are very good quality for the price.  They're  one of my favorite  brow pencils. I  have several other brands but use the elf most if the time.
"I didn't realize how much I needed this until I used it. Wow!
The primer is about my skin tone (not sure if the picture really shows it, but I'm very fair). It's lightweight, but can make the shadow look cakey if you don't spread it evenly over your lid. I wanted to show just how effective this thing was. I made a (admittedly terrible) swatch in the picture below;

I used a non-NYX shadow in the picture. The first swatch shows the pigment of the color without the primer.Next is just the primer on my skin, and the last is the shadow used on top of the primer. You can see just how awesome this primer is. Definitely worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This really makes my eyeshadow pop & stay in place. I absolutely love it!
I have oily eye lids and this product works perfectly!  I have tried expensive brands of eye primer with no luck so if it for me it will work for you too. You only need a little bit of this product for it to work all day/night long.  I fan my eye lids dry for about 5 seconds so it doesn't crease.  I highly recommend!
"I bought this a month ago, and I was a little skeptical at first because there were a lot of mixed reviews. But! I love this stuff. It applies evenly (I use my fingers) and it gives my lid tackiness that grabs on to pigment. Dries down quick and is ready to rock. It's perfect for all shadow formulas from drugstore to high-end; I use it with everything! Great product for a good price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't tried this to its full potential yet but I put this on for a couple of hours to get a test run in. My eyeshadow stayed on and there was minimum creases! Usually my eyeshadow gets rubbed off real quick but this helped it stay put.
I've only used this eye shadow base for couple days and I am happy with my purchase. I've seen a review that says its too oily but I beg to differ as I have naturally oily lids and this works just perfect. Shadows last all day without creasing. I love NYX products.
It worked on me. Texture is good. It also helped me fight off Zombies and help me become a better 2pac
"I haven't had the chance to use it all that much, but considering my eyeshadow lasted through a very humid day with eighty five degree temperatures, and me walking everywhere, I'm going to have to say mmmm... yes. It's a little different in texture than other products I've used, and a little bit goes a looooong way. But heck! That just means more for your money!"
Ordered the HD shadow primer after not being able to get the Proof It Primer. I can't find the proof it primer anywhere please bring this product back!! It's like liquid gold. This HD primer is awful compared to the Proof It!!!Unfortunately I'll be looking for a different brand to use :(
Just didn't work for me. Provided some color correction but my eyelids were a bit oily by the end of the day.
Best eye primer ever! Makeup stays in place the entire day!
My eyeshadow lasts all day and never cracks using this primer
Love love love! I have extremely hooded eyes and this makes my eyeshadow last all day
East to use. Nice application and staying power. I used it alone and with eyeshadow. Very pleased with this eye primer.
i use it for everyday makeup and it is so easy to apply with its brush and help to not have eyeshadow in the crease of your eyes. Help to keep your makeup in place all day long.
"I purchased this item after reading the reviews throughly; I was convinced and realized, I needed it for myself. My makeup last forever. My colors are more vibrant than before, I was extremely impressed... It will make your drugstore makeup pop even more.. Go head and see for yourself."
"very nice on the skin itself. doesn't feel too sticky but it's very good at sticking the shadow to it. the  pigment looks more vibrant and it doesn't look patchy if you smooth it out well. as my eyes are oily and crease a lot, this product helped a lot with that problems. now my eyeshadows last whole day."
"This is an affordable, easy to apply, neutral colored, and effective eye shadow base. I apply colorful bright and coordinating eye shadows everyday and I need it to look the same all day and not disappearing into my eye crease. Fortunately I have found the perfect base for my eyes that keep my shadow looking marvelous!"
"This eyeshadow base sets to a powder-like, matte finish that enhances any eyeshadows or eyeliners.  The universal peach shade goes on so sheerly that it's hardly noticeable.  Throughout the day, it also prevents my kids from getting oily and then creasing."
"This eyeshadow primer performs just as well, maybe better, than some high end primers. It will make any eyeshadow more vibrant, prevent creasing, and it lasts forever. One particularly long day, I applied this before my eyeshadow at 7am and it still looked great at midnight!"
"542 Brazen Raisen-This is my new favorite color!!! It's just the perfect shade of mauve and raisen color. This lipstick really does last all day! Even after eating and drinking, the color is still there, though it does usually needs to be reapplied after a few hours to my bottom lip. It goes on pretty dark and I Only need one coat. The lip coverup is nice and I can use it with or without the color, as moisturizer. When you first apply the color, make sure you let the coats dry completely before applying the top clear coat. Before you apply the top clear coat, your lips will feel dry and sticky. But once you apply the clear coat, it will feel perfect. I have tried many different brands of all day lip wear (including younique and lipsense) an..."
"I have used this product for years.  I've always used the same color, Braised raisin from day one. I've had alot of compliments on the color. I would & have recommended it to many people."
"512: Coral Sunset is a nice choice for a day at the beach, or going grocery shopping, just a classic causal color coordinating caution with coy intentions. i like it and i thought it wouldn't go with my Hispanic skin tone with very rosy cheeks, but it does!"
"I have worn this brand for 20 yrs. and love that it stays on my lips and off my cup, nor does it bleed around my mouth or get on my teeth. It doesnt dry my lips out like other brands I have tried. Even aftee having my lips permanently tattooed I enjoy the bold color I can achieve with Cover Girl Outlast!"
I absolutely love this lipstick I painted on at 12 hours later it still looks beautiful.. I have found I won't buy anything else love your product love the color love giving my lips a little bit of extra without having to use a liner..
I love this lipstick line and this color is really nice. The top coat is wonderful. A pretty decent dupe for Lipsense. Not exact but for the price it's great.
"Brazen Raisin is a nice color to wear alone, but I prefer it layered with colors like Berry, Plum and Dark Red for a nice, edgy evening look. Applied to clean/dry lips, and using the moisturizing top coat frequently, it can look fresh with minimal touch-up and easily lasts up to 12 hours."
"I like the short stem that reaches to lips. One other I tried had such a long ""stem"" that I was unable to control it. I also love the variety of colors and the fact that it is long lasting with a separate gloss."
Very cute it does last but I would recommend taking the gloss with you because it dries up quickly
"The listing on the website says 2 pack and at the time I purchased it the website showed 2 colored lipsticks and two clear top coats (4 items) which implied two boxes sets.  Only one boxed set arrived.    The description when digger further does describe one boxed set and the price does align with one boxed set but it is misleading to display the contents of two boxed sets on the initial screen from which I ordered.   It left me wondering if a pack fell out in the delivery guy's car or if my order has been improperly bagged.  Website people: Do better!!  

Product is excellent!!!"
I really LOVE this product BUT I am having a heckuva time in trying to dispense the gloss from the very top AND the very bottom of the cylinder!!!  WHY??? The applicator has a stiff shaft so it makes it impossible to try o retrieve from these problem areas.  Since I hate wasting anything - I use a Q-Tip.  I like the variety of shades that this product comes in and have my personal favourites.  PLEASE consider changing this applicator!!!  I am currently in the hunt for a comparable product but with a better applicator!!
"I've been wearing this lipstick for years. I love the fact it never comes off as I kiss my friends or my husband of 49 years.  It might wear off, but it never gets transferred. The wand is the perfect length for application and it goes on smoothly and evenly. I never use the lip gloss that comes along with it. I'm finding it difficult finding it in stores and I especially want the deeper redder shades. Her are some samples i've been forced to buy due to the lack of stock of Outlast in stores. They all wipe off with a tissue and come off far too easily. Please bring back the outlast even if it means new packaging."
"The only reason for this poor rating is that too much of the product is left unattainable in the acrylic tube.  The product itself is fabulous but in today's market, I am spending way too much money to throw a 3/4 empty tube into the waste can.  I do recommend but with words of caution.  Begging you to please redesign before I have to discontinue use."
I absolutely love this color. And this lipstick line is a great dupe for lipsense. Not exact but close. Awesome top coat.
Love how it stays on all day? The color makes me feel very confident. Love how it doesn't transfer on to my glass when I'm drinking. And I love how it's not sticky.
I just love this lipstick. It stays on all day it doesn't dry out my lips my lips are full with beautiful color it doesn't transfer to your clothes or your man thats a big plus.
I wish this Outlasted! I've used this product for 20+ years. It's off before dinner and needs renewed. There's always so much still in the tube that is unreachable. Any solutions to this?
I receive so many Compliments from this lipstick which I was worried was going to be too dark. But it seems like must do something because I never had open one door while wearing this.
"One of my favorite colors and it does ""Outlast"" regular lipstick. It's smudge proof, plus you can eat and drink and it still stays on, unless... you eat something greasy. Still, an awesome lipstick and worth every penny!"
I wasn't sure of the color ordering by onlinei but it was perfect I didn't see a number which comes at the end of the tube and that would be very helpful
It matches my skin tone very perfectly
"I loved!  It is soft, it is not heavy or marks the lines of expression.  it is moisturizing"
This product is so hydrating a great dupe for a higher end product. It doesn't cake and a little goes a long way. I also like the tone options within each category to be able to use a color corrector if needed as well. The lasting power is what truly blew me away. I wore it for an entire day on the lake and it didn't budge!
This is the best concealer I've tried in a while. Very creamy not oily at all. It blends well with or without foundation. It covers dark spots redness and scars with just a small amount no need to keep applying stays in place ok after it dries but if you set with a little powder it's even better.  The shades are really nice and easy to find one that matches your skin tone. especially love that it's a nice size tube so it lasts a little longer than the other ones I've tried. Overall it's a really good concealer works better than most of the more expensive brands I've used.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with this one. I'll definitely be buying again.
"Fantastic  concealer! The best i have found.
I am very fair skin. And fair rose is perfect for me.
Dark circles instantly gone. Hollowing of the eyes look alot less defined and dossnt go creppy or patchy.
Blended really well especially with the grip primer.

Smooth and soft to the skin. Camo... tick! Yes.
Hydrating...tick! Yes.
Lovely product.  Highly recommended"
"I'm very fair skinned. Often find consealers hard to match to ny complexion.
I went for Light Sand. When testing on my hand, it seem to have a yellow tinge to it. However, once blended in and warmed into the skin, this becomes less yellow and well blended to match. As a pale, neutral tonne to my skin i found this shade very qell matched.
Good wear to the product, however less is more. Adding to much will leave a creppy dry look so add a small amount then add if necessary  but spreads well  creamy, easy to blend, good wear and great size product for cost.

I used a beauty consealer blender to apply and blend consealer. You may find foundation then consealer for under eye if you have creppy skin already or consealer then foundation for da..."

"Over the past month, I have bought four different concealers, two in the same shade but hydrating versus 16-hour matte finish. Fair beige is too dark for me so for the winter I grabbed a hydrating concealer in fair warm since that's what I had in the matte finish. When I brought it home, it was not the same color at all and was also too dark. I finally went and bought the fair rose since that was the lightest, and it is pretty good. Look at the picture of the hydrating vs matte swatches both in fair warm. They should be close to identical and definitely are not. Confusing, huh?"
I got this to spoil myself a little and was sad to see that I will never use it. The color is about 2/3 shades darker than the outside container may look. I could only use this if I say in the sen for like a week. It is a concealer so I planned to use it under my eyes and in my blemished and it makes them stand out even more. I could use it as contour but I only wear light makeup and contour is not in my routine. Just go light than you think because the container and online pictures are deceiving!
SOOOO BADD DO NOT BUY!!! IT MAKES ME LOOK CAKEY AND TERRIBLE IT SEPERATES AND MAKES ME LOOK DRYYYYY EVEN THOUGH I HAVE OILY SKINNNNN I can't even finish it because it's so bad A MESS!!! Sandpaper
"While I absolutely love this line, this product may not be for me. The wand is massive and gets way too much product where I do not want it. It looks ridiculous when I try to blend it in. I will continue to try to work with it when I have time, but straight from the package, this is not a quick concealer you can just put on. You have to work it into place and make sure there is not too much product. It's a mess for me, honestly."
This is really full coverage but light color and I will use this for all the different ways listed.I like how their is a big doe foot for easy application.
Amazing amazing amazing!!!!!!!!! It’s literally a dupe to “shape tape” concealer! You can highlight/contour and conceal it’s truly the holy grail especially used with the CC cream!
"Once I got the hang of using it as a day is all you need around your eyes per say it was fantastic. I use less foundation or bb cream now as it covers alot of my marks I need covering. It's not heavy, lasts long, blends well, and doesn't leave any residue on clothes or dry chalky. The blending is impeccable and it's priced perfectly."
"I can see why people says it works great, but they barely have dark circles. Mine are literally purple, I try to cancel them out with a red Ishhh orange corrector but doesn’t seem to work with this concealer, on areas where I have a bit of discolouration (outer parts of my eyes) it works great"
I bought this and it’s hood but i think I’m going to try the other camo concealer instead because this one is to light for me
Very effective concealer covers dark circles and pigmentation very well. Only downside I will say is the colour does come much lighter than expected.
"the shade looked completely different on the website. the shade I was supposed to get was way less orange, I can't even use it."
Very good coverage. If you have very dark circles like I do this is a good one. Also I have sensitive skin and this doesn't seem to irritate.
"This is an awesome dupe for shape tape at a quarter of the cost! This is my new favorite concealer. It is creamy and full coverage. It
Covers even the darkest circles for me and makes me look fresh and awake!"
Like that I can do a lot of different exercises. Dislike that I have to change out the attachments. I add attachments the day before I exercise either upper/lower/full body so I'm ready for exercise in the morning.
"Easy to store, so far so good!"
"I like this product. It seems to be study, and will be great to take to beach on weekends. This is really useful that meets, which different requirements for any workout and aviods all the bulky equipment and machines. I would recommend, it is a good value."
I love that you can do multiple exercises with this. There's even a book to help you with areas you want to work on. The plus is you can pack it up and place itbon thenside to be out of your way.
Inexpensive full body workout
This product looks like a great one but honestly it is very cheaply made and was a very big let down
"This product is absolutely awesome! Almost too good to be true. I have yet to actually use it but it even comes with a book on workouts and different levels to start from. Just make sure you check to see if all the pieces are there because I had a black band missing. Also, make sure that you clean it because mine looks like someone returned it and cannot be too safe these days even peoples sweat is yuck!"
I got a set of glass dishes and not the workout equipment
"If you've used steppers to get around the ridiculous space requirements of even a small treadmill then you know how convenient they are.  I keep mine right under my Papasan or my Workstation and bring it out whenever I'm watching CrunchyRoll.  I'm doing 2,000+ reps without breaks between at the moment while using a 45lb Golds Gym Forearm Trainer at the same time for 2,200+ reps on it as well.  It's really convenient and I can get 2,000+ reps with each in under an hour watching CrunchyRoll.  The only thing you have to watch is the welds that hold the pulley in place .  Depending on their quality they can break as a great many have on Amazon's reviews of other stepper models from different companies.  This on is not Spot Welded  like the othe..."
"I honestly love this thing, there are not any bands or knobs to deal with! However, when I received it, two of the 'feet' were broken. I needed a new stepper badly, so I just glued them, but now it has started making awful noises and no amount of wd40 is helping! I can't upload a video so I can't show you the sound, but I'll update this review when I hear back from Stamina. 

I will say though, I seriously, seriously love this! I live in a tiny house so I use my mini stepper (the first one was a thrift store 'jack lalanne' find) as a treadmill to walk and 'jog' on with 2lb hand weights while I watch virtual scenery videos online - it's a high-end workout for less than $60! And it fits in small spaces, no need to spend $1000  for expensive b..."
i liked it at first quiet and worked fine after about two weeks it started squeaking and leaving black soot on floor i can only use it for 12 minutes or 100 steps not good for people that like high impact will be returning also i weigh 159 pounds and theres 6000 steps on machine basically equivalent to a good workout at gym for $63 no mam
The cord was hard at first but after watching a YouTube video I was able to get it on. I love the concept of it but it’s not giving me the step feel that I believe other steppers will. You hit the metal everytime you step down. The display monitor flashes off and on. I’m overall disappointed in its quality.
"After having a baby, I was excited to find a low impact exercise that can be enjoyed at home. 

During use, the equipment makes a sharp loud high-pitched noise. The noise wakes my newborn defeating the purpose of my purchase.

The stepper was delivered on March 20, 2023. On March 23, 2023, I contacted the manufacturer about the noise. Customer Support replied, “Thank you for contacting Customer Care.   Please try a white lithium grease on the shocks of your mini stepper.” 

On March 25, 2023, while applying the grease, I noticed the frayed cable. (See photo). 

I'm disappointed and despondent. I hope this is an isolated manufacture defect so other consumers   do not share in my dissatisfaction."
"I heard many good things about this stepper and read alll of the reviews before I ultimately purchased it. First of all, it’s not nearly as easy to get the cable onto the wheel as some people claim. It took me around an hour and I had to unscrew some things. I was fine with it once it was put together, it is pretty easy to use but it’s easy to lose your balance as well if you aren’t paying attention. The reason I’m giving this one star overall, though, is because I used this only TWICE and the wheel broke. It first completely fell out of the machine, and the wheel was snapped in half. I regret purchasing this machine and next time will pay a little more for better quality."
"Metal joint at the top of the right pedal cracked while I was 35 mins into a workout!
I weigh under 205 lb.

I also noticed some kind of weird, super dark dust after a workout coming from the pumps. Resembles toner out of the printer.
I wouldn't buy this again."
The step just broke off of the frame. I use it about 4 min a day (and only weigh 145 lbs btw) and the step just literally broke off.
Lasted less than a month before it broke
"Shot grease out of hydraulics and ruined my rug! I contacted the company and they said “I should just put it on a equipment mat”. It’s also very loud and squeaky and after using it for 20-30 minutes the hydraulics get VERY hot. Like hot enough to start a fire. For real, I don’t understand how they could sell this crap. I highly recommend going with another brand."
"the machine works but breaks in a few months of use.
The first time it broke after 2 months and the replacement unit broke after 5 months.
i'm ~140lb and i use it roughly 2 hours daily.
it's noisy but i don't care, i only wish it was built of heavier gauge metal at the pedal joins as it always break there."
"For the price it’s pretty good, it’s sturdy when you get comfortable on it and balance yourself. I placed a tall chair in front of me for the first few workouts to place my hands out the tall back seat part . My only dislike is it started to squeal/squeak. I have greased and WD40 and the noise will not go away. Makes the workout so much less enjoyable. You do need to give the springs a rest, which I made into a workout . I would do 15 mins and let the springs rest for 5 mins while I did arm weights or body strength training. Repeat."
"PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN.
This product broke in under 6 months and the company didn't honor the warranty because my 10 year old used it.  A hidden detail in the user manual. It is supposed to be for weight of up to 250lbs but at 136lbs and 20 minutes a day 3 times a week it just snapped and broke. This isn't their only product to break easily I also purchased the trampoline and the legs broke as well within 4 month of use. It's a waste of money."
"This is a good mini stepper for the price.  I wish it was just a little bit bigger, especially the foot pedals.  What I couldn't stand is the constant squeaking when operated.  I called customer service, bought the correct oil, oiled it, and it continues to squeak and squeal.  I may return it for that reason only %26 try another model.  Otherwise it has a great deep step for its size."
"It is not as well made as you would believe it to be!
Loved this little stepper!  Had it for 4 months. Used it 30 minutes a day 4-5 days a week. I am within the weight requirements at 120 lbs.   Got a good sweaty workout!!
Then it broke at the welded area & is not usable anymore...."
Weld on one of the foot holds snapped this morning.  I use a stepper every morning to start my day.  I've had this thing for about 30 days.  Disappointed.  Buy something more expensive.  I think the reviews here must be fake. Pictures show left weld is fine but the right weld just snapped.  Avoid this product.
LCD Monitor was damaged on arrival.
I really wanted this item(Mini stepper)! It was obviously an item that has been return a few times; pieces missing and no instructions. The box it came it had animal bites from previous purchasers and old return/order stickers. This was byfar the worth I've experienced ordering from Walmart(i understand time aren't the best yet i wouldn't even put this one out to order!)
Already cord has snapped. It broken already and I’m disappointed
"I liked this stepper, helped me feel more steady on my feet. It also gave me a cardio workout that is different and broke up my routine a little. Overall a very nice unit."
"It's better than i expected for the price. Its a little on the small side, but it just fits me and i am  6 ft 165lb.  Pleanty of weight to get started for and i can add more as needed."
"much nicer than i expected, especially for the price!! took about an hour to install and requires a wrench to tighten everything. the opening to lift the bar when laying down is very narrow, you almost have to shift your hands further out after unracking it but overall gets the job done."
"The CAP Strength Standard Combo Weight Bench with 90 lb. Vinyl Weight Set is a great set for beginners. The set includes 2 - 10 lb. weights, 2 -15 lb. weights and 2 - 20 lb. weights. The CAP Strength Standard Combo Weight Bench with 90 lb. Vinyl Weight Set was quite easy to assemble, with every nut and bolt labeled. Usually instructions for assembly give me a headache, and lead to utter frustration. In this case, however, the instructions read like it was for someone like me, not a handy person at all. The bench is very solid and sturdy, with a comfortable seat, complete with safety hooks to hold the bar in place when not in use. It is also equipped with a leg lift at the end of the bench that makes leg lifts easy, since you can put the wei..."
I am absolutely thrilled with my CAP Strength Standard Combo Weight Bench With 90 lb Vinyl Weight Set. I definitely recommend this product. I am so excited to be able to now workout at home. I really love how easy it was to put together with everything needed included with it and the manual was very easy to follow. I really love the freedom of being able to work out at home when I want to and how I want to. I also like that I can work on my arms and legs with the perfect amount of weight for me to lift I also love how sturdy and well made this set is and I don't have to worry about it breaking and fall on me. I also love how easy it is for me to add weight or remove weight for bench pressing and leg lifting as well. So if you are looking fo...
Not that hard to put together but one of the bars is missing from my order
The cap strength standard combo weight bench with 90lb weights is ok if your on the smaller side. It's not built for a large size man. Bench isn't made wide enough for that and you wouldn't be able to lie down between the bars to lift weights. It is nice start up set though.
CAP Strength Standard Combo Weight Bench with 90 lb is a Vinyl weight set is the perfect for the beginning strength training. Tools are not included. It's very difficult to install and need more man power.
"The bar is super short. I have about an 1"" on both side of grip if I am lucky (1/2""). I literally pinches your hands hard-core. It's a horrible design. I don't recommend (only cause of this reason)."
Metal pieces were bent
Missing parts
"I got this CAP Strength Standard Combo Weight Bench 
that comes with a 90 lb Vinyl Weight Set and I’m 
thrilled with it! It’s really nice and well made. It looks
really nice too. It has a very comfortable backrest and 
seat. It’s compact and easy to assemble. My husband 
and son both love it. It is the perfect starter bench. I
love that it comes with the weight set too. Very nice! I
definitely recommend this weight bench especially for
Beginners."
"My item was delivered today and the walmart website never updated to let me know it was coming, it still right now says it's preparing to be delivered.  I'm glad to have the item but the box it came in was really beat up, but so far the item itself doesn't look to be damaged, we are still taking it out of the box."
Shipment came almost two weeks later with no update other then me stalking the delivery method. Package was destroyed during shipping and returned to facility for further directions again no notice to me other then stalking the delivery link. Finally receiving the package 2 weeks later and the screw kit is missing on vital screw... no apologize for the delay or anything and honestly I feel I should have gotten a. Discount especially missing pieces?
"They left it at the end of the driveway!!! They didnt even bother to knock to let us know. App says they left it on porch, when really it was on the side of the road for anyone to take. Its in original packaging so everyone could see what it was and easily could've stolen it. I'm beyond mad. Besides the bad delivery.. the box was a little beat up. I havent opened it yet but lets hope all the peices are there."
wonderful Gym equipment  for me to use at home.  Wal-mart  made the purchase even better by the item on sale less $70.00!!  Thank u Wal-mart.   It payes to check the app and compare for the best money savings!!
Could not even accept the shipment as it was pack together both the bench and the weights which by the time it got to me the driver had to pick up pieces in my driveway as they had fallen out of the box......not good especially since I could not wait for it to arrive
"i read a lot of bad reviews about this product but decided if it was really that bad we could just return it to the store for a refund. it took my husband and i about 30 minutes to put it together. we followed the instructions exactly and they were clear and easy to follow. the bench is very sturdy, doesn't wobble or shake AT ALL. all those negative reviews must be by people that didn't follow the instructions or somehow got a defective product. my husband is 5'9"" and about 170lbs and my son is 6' and weighs over 200lbs and neither of them have had any problem using it at all. they didn't feel like it was going to collapse and no shaking. it's an amazing value for $70. we even bought additional weights to add to the bar and so far it's held..."
"TL;DR; (go to bottom for summary of pros and cons)
This will work for someone who will use this lightly and treat it delicately. I definitely do not see this as a viable option for anyone weighing more than 150 lbs. In case you can't tell from the image, let me just spell out that this bench has 3 legs. It makes it very wobbly. The other concern is with the seat and backrest, they do not seem like they can support much weight at all. Other than that , it works as intended (just don't move too much, as I said its wobbly). I think for light use and a light person who will treat this cautiously, this is a fair purchase. I gave this a 3 because the weights that come with it make it a great deal. That reminds me the weight bar is actually 2 piec..."
"I was looking for something cheap to help get me back into shape while I'm motivated, but also wanted something that wouldn't set me back too much so I don't care whenever I flake out. All new weight benches were extremely pricey, and even the used stuff costs more than this set...and neither the new or old came with actual weights. This was the perfect match of affordability and usability that came with all the pieces...they even delivered it to the Neighborhood WalMart right down my street for free! The only drawback to this item is that it really is kind of a kid's weight set. It's smaller overall and maybe a tad less stable than a more expensive set. But it's a tradeoff I was more than willing to accept and can deal with easily. And I'm..."
"The bench went together in about 30 minutes, and I put it together while my kids were climbing all over it and me. The construction was easy and the instructions were simple.

There is some wiggle to the bench when the weights aren't on it, but with weights on it stabilizes somewhat, even though there is some motion while you're lifting. My big issues are the distance between the braces isn't long enough, so I have to use a much more narrow grip then I'd like when bench pressing. The bar itself isn't long enough, especially since it has clay weights that take up much more room then steel. I also hate the clips to secure the weights, they don't have long enough grips to be able to quickly and easily remove them. Loading and unloading weights..."
"After seeing this online, i had to try it. I've been a bodybuilder for many years and after some time, you search for exercise variations. Especially for such a simple movement like a triceps extension. 
What i like:
- The ergonomics. The whole point is that your hands fit snugly in the molded handles and this feels terrific.
- The shape promotes CORRECT hand-path so no more cheating!"
I would like to take back my previous review and I apologize for not doing it sooner.  The seller did get back to me later the same day and assured me that the rest of the item was en route.  It did arrive 2 days after and I just finished assembling it.  I must say that the customer service was excellent and the power cage is awesome!!! I highly recommend this seller and gym equipment.
"Absolutely loved it. Worth every penny and I never have to step foot in a commercial gym again. If you’re good, you can have this thing put together in a half hour with a drill and crescent wrench. I expected it to be loud and rickety, but it’s the opposite. 10/10"
"I try to support our local GOLDEN gym and they did not have a pull down for one of the machines (they have 3) and so I donated this pull down to them and most people loved the handles over the stirrup type of handles. They are strong, you can adjust for one side to be shorter/longer than the other and the price was perfect for a quality piece like this. I am giving it 5 Stars and based on the fact most people at the gym liked this one better than the others I would say anyone would agree."
"Ergonomic grips fit a wide range of hand sizes, from small narrow hands to large beefy hands. The hand feel is great! The handles are a coated plastic material that seems durable, but we've only had them for a week or so. The rope is very sturdy and attached well to the handles. There is a plastic coated metal attachment with a hole for carabiners, however the product does not include a carabiner. Enough room to do full range of motion tricep pulldowns. Highly recommended getting these instead of the standard cylindrical handles."
great prize for everything that comes with it material is sturdy however I did receive one of the legs that was bent that the cable has to run through the tightening and loosening knob on the landmine was broken into pieces and the instructions are not wrote out very well
Shakes from side to side to much for my liking. Set up was easy. Price is the only reason I’m keeping it.
"The overalls quality of the rack is good,I received everything  in good condition, I don't like the safety bars that are included. They are hollow pipe and flimsy. I don't feel safe squating alone with them. Also the j hooks are too light and if you are not careful and hit it wrong you can jostle is out of place. I'll be replacing those part with heavier duty equipment."
"No instructions, manual, registration card, was this resold? All I have is a parts list probably from the repackaging guy. Please respond to my email and I will alter my review if I can get this up and running."
Only came with 1 double pulley wheel but called for 2!! CANT USE CABLE MACHINE SMH
great product! Takes about 5 hours to assemble (easier with 2 people) directions are clear. would recommend!
It looks good on line…  I’m  not happy with the product because it’s hard to get in contact with the customer…
"Excellent Customer Service. Responded to my concerns timely %26 resolved the issue. My 18 yr old assembled the unit quickly, no issues."
"Great quality all the pieces fit together perfectly. It took about 4 hours to assemble. It works and functions as expected. The instruction were very veg so unless you are good at assembling things it will be a challenge. There are also some items pictured (weights, bench) that are not included and it was unclear on the web site. It is well worth the money and a great value at the price."
"I think this is a nice item for starting the training of working out at home. The two elastic resistance bands of 30lb, two elastic resistance bands of 50lb bands, are very high quality and can be attached to almost anything. You can combine two bands on each side to make more resistance. You will not need the base to exercise with these bands. The fold-up base is very lightweight, making it portable. It includes a storage bag with the equipment to carry it. It also contains two collapsible workout bars, two wrist/ankle straps, a door anchor with a ring, and two padded handles. It is easy to install and change for different weight or workout."

"This portable gym is a very versatile workout tool. I work shift work and don't have access to my normal gym equipment. This portable home gym allows you to do upper and lower body workouts. The large press bar offered some tough resistance when both bands used. The door strap allows a variety of other shoulder exercises, not done on the board."
"It's nearly impossible to find any free weights during covid times. This was the next best thing I can find. Theres a lot of attachments that comes with this set which offers many various types of workouts. The resistance bands can be used with the board that comes with it or attached to doorways. The board is useful for arm exercises or some movements that's generally done with a barbell, e.g. thrusters, presses, rows. Although you can kind of do back and front squats, there's not enough resistance for those two movements. You end up only doing ""half squats."" That's probably my only complaint with this. However, you can get creative with it and come up with some good movements and workouts. The set includes a workout sheet with many exerci..."
"I really like my PHG. It gives me an outlet for suppressed stress and I'm less likely to have an injury. Don't get me wrong, I still love curling 80 lb. dumbbells; but I have terrible joint pain. It's so simple to use that i train on it 3 times a week and I run the other two days. Trust me you'll love it!"

"Great little addition to a home gym that easily hides away in a cabinet, closet or under furniture. I have a small workout space so the fact it has a bag for everything and can be put away is great! The board to stand on is a little flimsy but still worth the money. I have a pull up bar and the tension ropes attach to it which is a bonus!"
"I am used to working out in a ""full"" gym, however, with the ""lock-down"" this looked like a fairly decent option. I tend to lift heavy weight with low reps, which is not really an option with this but you can switch to high reps and still get a bit of a workout.I would say that depending on your height you need to get creative with how you connect the bands to the base. Just clipping them give next to zero resistance. With some looping, you can shorten up the band and increase that. Just a warning, I did notice that loop can cause the edges of the base to want to lift when you near the full range of the band. Hasn't cause an issue yet, but time will time if this is going to damage the base.Overall, it's not a bad addition to a home gym, but ..."
I don't like the fact it really isn't made for shorter people.
"I don't like it, the bands are way to long for someone who is 5 feet 6 inches tall. You can use it but you don't get a work out. If you're 6 feet tall I can see how it would work. It was a waste of money."
"This thing is AH-MAZING!!! Bought this for the sake of getting back into shape, after having three kiddos. The versatility of this might gym is insane. Takes a little bit of getting used to, switching up the bands and hooks. You get full (rom) range of motion and it will kick your ass.You may need to purchase additional bands, but you can definitely double up the ones that come with it. There are a set of 50# and 30# resistant bands. Adjustment and placement of your bands are extremely important. Wish there was more of an instructional guide for workouts, but that's what youtube is for, right!? HahaAll in all, enthusiastic about my purchase and if you're dedicated to your workout regimen, this little gym will give you results that thousands..."
"This exceeds my home gym expectations. I am able to work out my whole body with resistance and then store it under the bed when done. I am so sore after using this so I know its working. This is exactly what I needed. The gym would be great for a dorm room, an apartment or even anyone like me who just wants something they don't have to stare at in the middle of a room. Very impressed, would recommend."
"This portable home gym is as advertised. It's exactly what I need for the space that I have. The only negative I have so far is related to the bar. It kinda hurts on my neck/shoulder area but can be remedied by using either a cushion or a by wrapping a towel. I feel as though I have had a complete work out but that could also be because I do other stuff before using this product. i.e walking, elliptical, and trampoline. This product works on arms mainly, I haven't done many leg things with it. I also need to search the web for a more complete work out plan. Other than that, it is definitely worth the money. I only paid $49.99 after coupon and discount. Money well spent!"
I was looking for resistance bands that came with the option for a bar as well has hand grips. This delivers. I love the platform and various tension abilities. The door anchor was a nice bonus.The ONLY thing I don't like is the clip used at the end of the straps (see pic). The clip is too small to accomodate the wide strap so that the clip hangs right. I plan on buying rings to put in the strap then attach the clip to the ring. Hopefully that will fix the problem.I can't yet speak to the durability as I've only had this for a day and used it once.
"After months of being unable to go to the gym due to Covid, it was time to do something to get back into shape. This equipment has been excellent at getting in some full body workout. The amount of resistance has been plenty for me. It's also easy to store, which comes in handy when you are limited on storage space."
I got this because i hate the gym but love running. This allowed me to work my upper body in my tiny apartment and is very compact to store and use. Having 2 sets of belts allowed me to skip low weights and start curling around 30lbs and being able to route the cords thru the hooks on the platform made it simple to up the weight in the future. This was well worth the capabilities it now gives me especially during these times.
"Bought this in January when things were still closed due to the pandemic. I love that it folds up nicely and stores against a wall or under a bed. The item itself is pretty awesome, aside from the plastic base. Initially, I was pretty bummed with the resistance, but upon further exploration, you simply shorten the length of the bands by pulling through other loops and connecting. Makes a HUGE difference. Lightweight and portable - makes an excellent addition to a home gym and easy to take with when traveling by car."
I held off to write a review until I got to use it a little bit. I like that it folds away and stuff can be put inside a bag and it don't take up much room! This is perfect for staying at home and getting a little fitness in. The product is as stated is less cost then other similar products. Overall I would recommend!
There is a lot that can be done with this portable gym and looking forward to getting full workouts in. The only negative I see is that the user manual & training guide did not make the trip with the rest of the equipment. It would be nice to have them.
"I really like my PHG. It gives me an outlet for suppressed stress and I'm less likely to have an injury. Don't get me wrong, I still love curling 80 lb. dumbbells; but I have terrible joint pain. It's so simple to use that i train on it 3 times a week and I run the other two days. Trust me you'll love it!"
"Really nice bench, especially for the price. Sturdy and comfortable."
Very happy with this bench! I have limited space so the ability to easily fold and store the bench is ideal for me. The bench was missing the pads on the foot rest but I contacted Gymenist and within a couple of days I received them in the mail. Although not guide as heavy duty as the benches at the gym it has more angle settings including a decline that the gym benches do not have. Thank you!
"Definitely recommend! I live in an apartment complex, 3rd floor, so its Perfect for my balcony! I can do ALL exercises imaginable and then fold and store for space purposes. I definitely recommend!"
"This bench is Perfect for anyone that wants to add to their home gym
Easy to Fold Open and Store when not in use.
adjustable Back, Adjustable Pad , Comfortable. Sturdy."
"I like that there was no assembly needed. This works perfect for me as I have limited space. It's very easy to fold up, and easy to use  inclines and declines. I'm not sure it would hold up if you are bench pressing 400 lbs but for lighter weights like 200-250 I think it' will be just fine"
"Excellent purchase! Sturdy, easy to use, right out of the box, no assembly necessary. Folds really easy and you can put it away really fast. You can do many exercises with dumbells and some without. Very safe. Much cheaper here in Walmart compared to other sites."
"5 Stars for the value. It's well made for a bench that costs less than $100. I use it for bench press (2 plates), incline press, dumbbell fly, and barbell skull crushers. Works great for me. I weigh ~185 and it feels solid to me."
"Amazing incline, decline and flat bench.  Folds up and can be put away.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality."
This is a great bench. Sturdy and folds nicely for easy put away.
"Seems like a decently constructed bench, but its only 15 inches high which renders it useless. I dont know of any rack that would accommodate such a low bench. So disappointed that no other reviews mentioned bench height! Nor did I see anything in the specifications about it.  It is easy to set up and fold up. The bench next to it sits 6 in higher for comparison. I will be returning"
Pretty sturdy for its size and cost.  A good value and ideal if you have limited space and need to fold it up.
"I bought this for my 18 yr old son - I pretty much picked this because it was a lot cheaper than the other benches I looked at and also the leg thingys have thicker looking foam pad thingys. My son said it is fine for his needs and is happy with it, he said it was sturdy and adjusted to whatever positions he needed it to be in (I have no idea what those positions are). Besides the great price, the other great thing about this is the only assembly you need to do is slide on the foam pad thingys. It's already assembled right out of the box. I personally could not carry this up the steps but my son was able to carry it inside the house and into his room LOL."
"My exercise bench was delivered on the date that Walmart said it would arrive. As I opened the large box it arrived in, I could tell immediately that I had made the right purchase. This weight bench is made to last. Extremely strong and sturdy too. It also comes with an adjustable head rest that you can remove if you desire. It can also easily be moved into the position you choose with the easy pull out pins. Very lightweight and eazy to fold up and move around. I'm very happy with it so far."
"Bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he loves it! It's compact and easy to assemble. The only negative was that there was some mold on the underside of it; perhaps whilst is storage it got damp? Anyways, I cleaned it thoroughly with disinfectant and it was good as new. My husband uses is everyday as he is a fitness fanatic and he is very happy with it."
"You delivered as promised, great bench!"
"sturdy, space-saving and versatile!"
Great bench. Easy and sturdy. Great bang for your buck
exceeded expectation for this price!
"I like the no assembly and the number of settings for the back, seat and foot rest. Priced well also."
Excellent was able to preform all three major lifts along with decline crunches very sturdy product.
"Open the box, took me only 15 minutes to put together, not too difficult. It's very sturdy. When I sit on it, I was about able to do sit-up and other workout. I can carry this to different rooms in the house. This would be a daily mini workout station."
"The padding is soft and firm. I use it every day, it is stronger than the expected. The assemble instructions was much clear than i have ever seen. The thicken foam protect my legs, minimize the fatigue and increase the friction. Everything is fine. The exercise bench meets my needs. I and my husband love it. Thanks."
"After moving from a major city where I was at the gym five days a week to a rural environment where getting the mail is exercise -- well, I started to get a bit rotund.

The machine arrived very well packed and devoid of damage. I was very happy to see that the required assembly involved a small number of parts, a good set of instructions and the necessary tools to complete the process.

I started with ten setups a day for the first three days and after a week, I'm up to forty a day. Yes, it's not so easy when your out of shape, but after a week I can feel results - have already lost that ""jelly belly"" feeling when walking. My guesses that in two months I will have a flat stomach once again and I have every confidence that the machine will ..."
"Personally, I think it's OK. The installation is simpler than expected. I wanted to buy a large one, but now I'll buy a small one first. The price is also very reasonable since It's very light and very useful. With the bench, you can exercise all over the body. You can practice for 20 to 30 minutes every day. You don't have to go to the gym."
"A good bargain for a medieval torture device that is sure to have your abdomen is searing pain for days after each session.  If you are a true masochistic warrior, this is for you.  Be sure to select the best surgeon available for your emergency hernia surgery.  Have their office on speed dial, along with the fastest ambulance service in your area."
"Works as advertised.  I was looking for a sit up bench that would be easy to store so I could fit it in my bedroom/apartment easily, and this fit the bill.  Sturdy and no wobble when doing sit ups or using the accessory features like push up handles.  The exercise bands didn't have enough tension for me, but those would be easy to replace with higher tension bands.  Overall great product and makes sit up/core training a cinch."
"Definitely a good price. Took me less than 10 minutes to assemble. It is very light to carry but solid. I had some good expectations after reading some reviews, but this is a lot better than I expected.
I use this bench to sit up and leg raise.
I am 5'10 and 160lbs."
"My basement is a small gym with all kind of equipment. I often take my two sons there to exercise. During these time, the COVID 19 pandemic outbreak in the united states, especially in new york city, We all were asked by goverment to stay at home. So We spent most of our time in our little gym. Of all the exercise equipments, our favorite is this sit-up bench. because this is a multifunction sit-up bench. It features a flat inclined design and with the padded rolling cushions on back which perfectly support  your body and eliminate back and neck strain. It makes  your comfertable and safe while exercise. Also equipped with 2 pull ropes, this sit-up bench can not only for abs, but also good for strentching, leg workouts, twists, back sit-up ..."
"Solid bench, not wobbles, this means most important for my sister. packing is all in good condition and took me 10 minutes to put together, when my sister is not using it she can store it almost anywhere, it is fold-able. Worth way more than it costs, my sister is quite pleased with my purchase."
"Great unit. Doesn't take up much space, but works very well."
"Perfect for what I need. Even since I had baby, my back has always bothered me. It’s painful every single day! My back is always stiff and it has affected my personal health. Being a full time mom, I don’t have the luxury to go out much. So I purchased this lil sit-up bench. It helps me a lot. Highly recommended!"
"I received the package in the time frame it was promised- which was very promptly.

The package was sturdy. Not too heavy but heavy enough to know this was a good quality item.

Directions were easy to read. It took me 10 mins to assemble - by myself. The time also included a good 5 mins on tightening the bolts. I recommend using two socket wrenches. I am 5'11"" and 150 lbs.

Very Fast Shipping!!!"
I am very pleased with this incline bench. It was easy to assemble and it is very sturdy. I have had it for a month now and it has greatly helped me to get my core stronger. It is very suitable for tall and heavy set people as I am 5'10 and around 200lbs. I also love the fact that it is foldable and can be put away in a corner or closet if need be to save space. I am very pleased.
"Really great bench the size fits perfectly in my living room, very easy to assemble, got it together all by myself, the bench is comfortable not too soft or hard just right, the size is just right for me! Perfect new workout item for me and my family"
"Upon receiving this ab bench, it only took me a few minutes to put together. The instructions are easy to understand and follow. Although the equipment looks flimsy, it still very solid while I was using it."
"This device is a big part of my family's exercise routine before!It is easy to assemble, works with adjustable height knobs, and remains stable even when used on carpets.It's great to use it every day!"
"it is a great product it is very strong and is very durable The padding is very nice too. nut when you et it dont put the top foam piece on backward , otherwise it is very hard y get your legs in ."
"Woah, now I live sit-ups, but this bench brings them to an insane level of time well spent. I was super sore the first day after. Granted it’s been a while, but this price was well worth spending for the extra motivation to get moving. Love it!"
This bench is suitable for every one in our family so we use it every day. The price is a steal. It only took 2 day to arrive our home and was packed firmly.
"need more comfortable hand grips for push ups they are too narrow
bands are too flexible/ stretchy it needs more tension for effective exercises
we do sit ups and legg lifts"
it is the best thing you can get for somone that is bead ridden to build strength its great and easy to use and asimbly was easy
Great exerciser for seniors or people with limitations. Well worth the price.
next day shipping good price and quality easy to use.
"The unit is ok. Not as stable as I thought. The LCD is a little hard to navigate. This unit is good for short people, I'm 6'4"", I have to sit further away to use comfortably."
"It’s a nice iPad for my daughter, it came in the mail with no scratches, it came a day late but overall it was worth it"
I love it so much.It was a great investment especially me being in college I most definitely needed it. It has a great battery. Transferring all my stuff was a breeze.And yes it did come in the actually box with the charger and block.
Liked so much best quality best price
I got what I paid for in the time that was told to me. Very happy with my new IPad.
"I’m disappointed. Everything is good about this iPad except…it’s durability is awful. This is a completely unsupported section along the top by the forward facing camera that has no support behind it. Just empty space. If too much pressure is applied with just your fingers tips it will break and cave it immediately cracking your screen and leaving a hole. Now that the hole is there in just that one spot the whole durability of the screen is now weak and compromised.
I would not expect Apple to make a product that had such a gap in between glass and the framework. I have AppleCare but it’s ridiculous that I already have to pay out of pocket to have it fixed for a poorly designed piece of hardware that could have easily had this gap supported..."
I love it
My package was delivered today. It was hanging on my mail box that is right on a road. I have NEVER had any package delivered to my mail box. I live on a rural road and can't see my mailbox from my house. The driveway was plowed. There would have been no reason why the could not drive up  like they normally do. If it hadn't been the fact my husband was leaving I would not have known the package was there as my husband brought it in 10 minutes before I got a text. It was  $400.00. iPad to be left basically on the side of the road. I am beyond mad
Well if I had the iPads I’d be able to tell you how I liked them but instead they were left on my porch for everyone to see even tho they could have been put behind something and they were stolen and Walmart won’t do anything to help me so now I’m asked out 650$ with no iPad for Christmas
"The iPad works great and the CSR I chatted with for price check was excellent. He even gave me an extra $10 less than the competitor. My only issue with the purchase is shipping. Walmart, please stop using FedEx! They left the package in the middle of my carport. I almost ran it over because it was so small. The front porch is a closer drop off than the carport. This has happened on more than one occasion with a WM order. USPS and UPS take the time to place it in a safe place."
I didn’t know a lot about IPads but I really wanted one to stream Netflix and use it for college. I understood it’s an older one but i’ve had this tablet for about a month and i absolutely love it. i’ve had zero problems and the battery life is actually really good. if you don’t want to spend a fortune on a new ipad i highly recommend this one. and i also bought a knock off version of an apple pencil from walmart too and i love it and it was very affordable. all around i love this tablet!!
My previous iPad (2014) was indicating that I was running out of storage room no matter how many aps I deleted. This new one is 256 and I am amazed at how many bells and features I was not seeing on aps previously - apparently because I did not have enough storage to see all the features.  The picture quality is super sharp.
"For the iPad itself, I found it amazing to my standards. The interface is smooth and animations don't lag. Although I did notice it would freeze for a few seconds when going to fast, but I guess I should've expected that from an economic iPad from 2 years ago. Games play well, and rhythm games are a lot easier thanks to the big screen and amazing response time. I would recommend this tablet if you need a simple tablet with a headphone jack. But beware of delivery. FedEx is known to be careless with its packages, even if it is a quite expensive tablet. Of course, you should necer have any technology delivered to you if you live in an apartment, but I stilk did it. They dropped it off at another apartment that ordered something from Walmart a..."
Love my new iPad!!!
My daughter loves it
I like iPad
Amazing
The battery overheated on this it’s 4 1/2 months old it got so hot that it bent the iPad all enclose a picture.
"For now the 9th Generation only goes up to IOS 15.7.  It could not restore ICloud from my phone.   (My phone is updated to IOS 16.0.3).  I spent more than 2 hours on this problem, including taking it to an authorized Apple tech service company.  Until Apple fixes this problem, I cannot recommend this IPad and I might have to return the two 9th Generation iPad’s that I purchased."
